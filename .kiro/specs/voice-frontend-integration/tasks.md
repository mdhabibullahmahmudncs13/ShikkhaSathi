## Notes

- Each task builds incrementally on previous tasks
- Voice features should enhance, not replace, existing text functionality

- Voice data should be processed securely and not stored permanently
- Implementation should follow existing code style and architecture patterns
- Regular testing with real users (Bengali and English speakers) is recommended
