Learning Path API Endpoints

API endpoints for learning path recommendation, assignment, and management.

Requirements validated:
- 4.1: Personalized learning path recommendations
- 4.2: Difficulty adjustment based on performance
- 4.3: Learning path assignment and tracking
- 4.4: Progress tracking and milestone notifications
