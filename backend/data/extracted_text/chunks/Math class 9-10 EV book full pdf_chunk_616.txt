Now we put the possible values of x:
If 2 = 0, y = 0 minute i.e. 12:00.
Ife=11: 52 minute.
11
Ifr=22: 1020 minute.

If x = 11, 11 : 60 minute or, 12 : 00.
As the first and last times are same, these two hands coincides 11 times and the
60
times are: x: —x minute.

Work: If in triangle ABC ZB = 22°, /C = 2°, ZA = y° and ZA =
4B + ZC, find the value of x and y.
