We can imagine resistances R| and R, as a single resistance R, where

Figure 11.12: Many successive resistances or resistors connected in
a circuit can be imagined as an equivalent resistance or resistor.
If there were more than two resistances (figure 11.12) then also we would be able
to show that these resistances can be combined as a single resistance R which
will be the sum of all those resistances. This is called the equivalent resistance.
This means when a circuit will have R , R,, R, ... resistances successively (series
circuit) then the equivalent resistance will be:
R=R, +Ry+Rs+..+R,
