========================================

Speed is the rate of change of distance with respect to time. Therefore, if you
have covered 100 m distance in 20 second, your speed will be;
100 m
VE 5m/s
The dimension of speed [vy] = 17-1
Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. Therefore, if
the change of your position along a certain direction is 50 m in 20 second, then
magnitude of your velocity will be;
_ 50m _ 25 m/
V=o0s 0m
And that certain direction is the direction of velocity.
As velocity is a vector quantity, we will have to fix its direction.
The dimension of velocity [v] = LT™*
. Here, one thing has to be noticed. If we consider only linear motion, then there
Sis no difference between velocity and speed, the magnitude of velocity is the
