=8log V3 =8x1=8[log,a=1]
Example 7. 1) What is the log of 5/5 to the base of 57 2) If the log of
400 is 4, then what is the base of log?
Solution:
1) Log of 5/5 to the base of 5
= log;5v/5 = logs (5 x 5%) = logy?
3
= logsd [-log,M" = rlog,M]
3 3
=5x1=5[loga=1]
2) Let the base be a
.. By the question, log,400 = 4
cat = 400 or, at = (20)? = {(2v/5)?}? = (2v/5)*
