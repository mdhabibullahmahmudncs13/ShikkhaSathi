marble.
Finding the velocities of two objects after collision and using that concept we
will be able to explain the incidents of road accidents easily.
3.5.2 Safe Journey: velocity and Motion
In the next chapter we will be able to understand kinetic energy in detail when
we will learn about energy. But already we know that the kinetic energy can be
expressed by mu? while reading about collisions. The topic is very important
for discussion regarding travelling. The term kinetic energy contains the square
of the velocity, this means if the velocity is doubled then energy will increase by
four times. When two cars in an accident collide, then due to this energy both
cars are damaged and the passengers are injured. Therefore to minimize the loss
