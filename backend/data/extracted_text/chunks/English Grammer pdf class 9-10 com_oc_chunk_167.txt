Note: May implies stronger possibility than might, i.e. might, like may,
expresses possibility, but in a lesser degree. For example, if we say, ‘We might
go to the museum today’, there is less chance of going there than when we
say, ‘We may go to the museum today’.
Another function of may is to express permission:
May | use your telephone? May | ask you a question?
Those who have finished writing may leave the exam hall.
Activity 1 Write may/might + an appropriate verb in the following gaps.
a: Are you going out? | think you should take an umbrella.
: Why? It's not raining, is it?
: No, but there are dark clouds in the sky, and it
anytime.
b : Shall we invite Kanak to go to the movie with us?
