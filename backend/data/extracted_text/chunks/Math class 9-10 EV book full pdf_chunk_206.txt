Chapter 4. Exponents and Logarithms 87
Logarithms
Logarithms are used to find the values of exponential expressions. Logarithm
is written in brief as Log. Product, quotient, etc. of large numbers or quantities
can easily be determined with the help of log.
We know, 2° = 8; this mathematical statement is written in terms of log as
log,8 = 3. Again, conversely, if log,8 = 3, it can be written in terms of exponents
as 2° = 8. That is, if 2° = 8, then log,8 = 3 and conversely, if log,8 = 3, then
; 1 1 1
2% = 8. Similarly, 27% = ¥=3 can be written in terms of log as, logy3 ==3.
If a® = N,(a > 0, a # 1), then z = log, N is defined as a based log, N
Note: If a > 0,then a” is always positive whatever may be the values of x,
