Example 1. In triangle AABC, AB = AC, BA is produced to D such that
AD = AC. C, D are added.
1) Draw the figure based on the stem.
2) Prove that, BC + CD > 2AC
3) Prove that, ZBC'D = 1 right angle.
Solution:
1)
D
X
B Cc
2) Given, AB = AC and by construction AC' = AD
For ABCD
BC + CD > BD [The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is
greater than the third side.]
or, BC+ CD > AB+ AD
or, BC+ CD > AD + AD
or, BC'+ CD > 2AD
o. BC+ CD >2AC [AB = AC = AD)
3) Given AB = AC Therefore ZABC = ZACB
Hence ZDBC' = ZACB
By construction AC = AD. Therefore ZADC = ZACD
Hence ZBDC = ZACD
In triangle ABCD,
ZBDC + ZDBC + ZBCD = 2 right angle [Sum of three angles of a triangle 9
is equal to 2 right angles] S
