Magnetic Effects of Current 335

several times. This coil is called a solenoid. A strong magnetic field can be

generated by that coil. Every loop of the coil will create a magnetic field due to

the electric current flowing through it. So the combined magnetic field is

stronger.

the current through a loop.

If current flows through a circular coil, then the direction of its magnetic field

can also be found with the help of the right hand rule. The thumb indicates the

direction of the magnetic field, while the other fingers show the direction of the
