========================================

at the centre stands on a minor arc of the circle. In 7 B

the figure APB is the minor arc. So the vertex of an A

angle at the centre always lies at the centre and the

sides pass through the two terminal points of the arc. ZN c

To consider an angle at the centre standing on a semi- 8

circle the above description is not meaningful. In the NEY

case of semicircle, the angle at the centre ZBOC' is

a straight angle and the angle on the arc ZBAC' is a

right angle.

Theorem 20. The angle subtended by the same arc at the centre is double of
the angle subtended by it at any point on the remaining part of the circle.
Given an arc BC of a circle subtending angles ZBOC'

at the centre O and ZBAC at a point A of the circle A

ABC.
