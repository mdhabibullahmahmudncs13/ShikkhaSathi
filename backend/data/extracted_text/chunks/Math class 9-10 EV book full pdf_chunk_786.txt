Solution: 211 metre 20 cm = 21120 cm
Let, the radii of two wheels are R and r respectively ; where R > r.
.. Circumferences of two wheels are 27 R and 27r respectively and the difference
of radii is (R —r).
As per the question, 32 x 27 R = 21120.

oR —7r = (105.04 — 70.03) = 35.01 cm = 0.35 m (approx.)
The difference of radii of the two wheels is 0.35 metre (approx.)
Example 25. The radius of a circle is 14 em. The area of a square is equal to
the area of the circle. Determine the length of the square.
Solution: Let the radius of the circle, 7 = 14 cm and the length of the square is a.
-. Area of the square region = a” and the area of the circle = r?.
