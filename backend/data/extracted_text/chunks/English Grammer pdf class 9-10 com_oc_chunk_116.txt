Grammar point
Form
We make the past continuous by using the past of the auxiliary verb be (was,
were) and the —ing form of the main verb:
She was talking. They were arguing.
We make questions by putting the auxiliary verb (was, were) before the
subject:
Was she crying? Why were they arguing?
And we make negatives, by adding not/n’t to was/were:
She wasn’t shopping. They weren't working.
Use
We use the past continuous to talk about things which were in progress at, or
during, a particular time in the past:
At 4 o'clock | was studying at the library.
At that time yesterday, my friends were playing football in school.
Activity 1 Write down the questions for the following answers.
| was waiting for the bus at about 4.30 today.
