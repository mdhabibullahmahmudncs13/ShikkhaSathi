5.6.1 Molecular Kinetic Theory of Matter
If a solid substance is kept on a table, the solid exerts a kind of pressure on the table, on
the area of the table which it touches. If we want to put some liquid on the table instead
of solid, it will not work; the liquid will spread over the table. Liquids have to be
contained in a pot and the liquid exerts pressure not only on the bottom of the container
but it exerts pressure on the walls of the container in all directions. (If a hole is created in
