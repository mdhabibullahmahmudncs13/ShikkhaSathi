========================================

variable is assumed instead of the unknown quantity and then equation is formed

by the given conditions. Then by solving the equation, value of the variable,

that is the unknown quantity is found.

Example 5. The digit of the units place of a number consisting of two digits is

2 more than the digit of its tens place. If the places of the digits are interchanged,

the number thus formed will be less by 6 than twice the given number. Find the

number.

Solution: Let the digit of tens place be z.Then the digit of units place will be

T +2.

.. the number is 10x + (x + 2) or, 11x +2

Now, if the places of the digits are interchanged, the changed number will be

10(z +2) + x or, 11x + 20

By the question, 112 + 20 = 2(11z +2) — 6

or, Ile +20 = 22x +4 — 6
