========================================

(b) When it travels on a thick wire to a RT ill be
narrow wire another type of reflection occurs
a loose rope.
(iv) Reflection or refraction occurs for waves, it is discussed elaborately for
light, in the next chapter. At present you know that at the time of travelling from
one medium to another medium, if part of a wave returns back to the first
medium, it is called reflection (Figure7.02). When a wave travels from the first
medium to the second, it is refraction.
When we hear an echo of sound, it is
reflection. If we hear external sound when
we are submerged under water it is due to aN
refraction of sound. + +
(v) Among all the characteristics of waves,
the most important is superposition, even \ / \ /
though this is not observed often by our eyes
