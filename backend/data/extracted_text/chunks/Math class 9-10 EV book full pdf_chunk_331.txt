Theorem 6. If two sides of a triangle are equal,
the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.
Suppose in the triangle ABC, AB = AC. Then,
ZABC = ZACB
B Cc
Theorem 7. If two angles of a triangle are equal, the sides opposite the equal
angles are also equal.
A
Special Nomination: Let, in the triangle ABC,
ZABC = ZACB. Tt is to be proved that, AB = AC
D,
B Cc

Proof:
Step 1. If AB # AC, then (i) AB > AC or, (i) AB < AC.

Suppose, (i) AB > AC. Cut from AB a part AD equal to AC. Now, the

triangle ADC is an isosceles triangle. So,

LADC = LZACD [. The base angles of an isosceles triangles are equal]

In ADBC exterior angle ZADC > ZABC [. [Exterior angle is greater

than each of the interior opposite angles]
