Solution of simple simultaneous equations
We shall discuss the solutions of only the consistent and independent simple
simultaneous equations. Such system of equation has only one (unique) solution.
Here, four methods of solutions are discussed :
0 1. Method of substitution 2. Method of elimination 3. Method of cross-
5 multiplication 4. Graphical method.
