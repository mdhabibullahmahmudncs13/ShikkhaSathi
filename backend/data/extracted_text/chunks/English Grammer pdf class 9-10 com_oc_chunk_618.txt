========================================

- a future tense to talk about future time, e.g. in 2030, next year
We often use the following expression when talking about future or predicted
data, because the simple future is a little too certain:

.. arefis {un)likely

... arefis predicted to

... arefis expected to

For example: Between 1950 and 2030, the proportion of the world's

population is expected to double.
OR we use a verb such as predict and a future tense.
For example: It is predicted that the proportion of the world's population will
double by 2030.

2 To emphasise a difference, you can use: many, much, far, and significantly.
