========================================

ray OC is in the inner side of the angle and makes
two angles ZAOC and ZC'OB.So taking together the
measurement of these two angles is one right angle. 0 B
The angles ZAOC and ZCOB are complementary
angles.
Supplementary angle
If the sum of two angles is 2 right angles, two angles
are called supplementary angles. c
The point O is an internal point of the line AB. OC
is a ray which is different from the ray OA and ray
OB. As a result two angles ZAOC and ZCOB are
formed. The measurement of this two angles is equal <4 0 B
to the measurement of the straight angle ZAOB i.e.,
two right angles. The angles ZAOC and ZCOB are "
supplementary angles. g
