Appendix 407
Theorem 14:
The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length
of the third side.
Special Nomination: Suppose in AABC, BC is
the largest side. We need to prove that p
(AB+AC)>BC.
Drawing: Extend BA up to D such that
AD=AC. Join C and D.
& c

Proof:
1. In AADC, AD=AC. [The angles opposite the equal sides of an isosceles
triangle are equal]... ZACD=/ADC.". ZACD=/BDC
2. /BCD>ZACD.
Therefore, /BCD>/BDC.
3. In ABCD, ZBCD>/BDC.
Hence, BD>BC. [The side opposite the greater angle is greater]
4. But BD=AB+AD=AB+AC [Since AC=AD]

.(AB+AC)>BC. (Proved)
