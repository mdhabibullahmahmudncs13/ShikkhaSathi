examples of some instruments used in medical science in the final chapter). At
present the greatest contribution behind civilization is of electronics and physics
has the greatest contribution to this technology also. Besides daily activities,
from destruction of war to space exploration, the contribution of physics is
present. Not only that, by the combination of other branches of science and
physics, newer branches have developed, for example, astrophysics consists of
astronomy and physics. In order to explain organic processes, biophysics has
been built up by the combination of biology and physics, chemical physics was
born by the combination of chemistry and physics. Use of physics in Geology
has developed Geophysics. Medical physics has flourished using physics.
