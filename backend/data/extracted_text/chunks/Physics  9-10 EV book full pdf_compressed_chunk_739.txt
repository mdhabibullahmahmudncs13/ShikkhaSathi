========================================

Now we can do an experiment. Suppose, using glass and silk we have positively
charged two pieces of glass. If we carefully hang one piece of glass with
insulator silk and then bring the other close to it then we will notice that the glass
that is hanging is going away due to repulsion (Figure 10.03).
Similarly if we charge negatively two pieces of plastic and hang one of them
with silk thread and bring the other near to it, we will see the same result, one is
repelling the other. Now if we bring the positively charged glass rod near to the
negatively charged plastic rod, then we will see, they will attract one another.
‘When we learnt gravitational force, there was only one type of mass, so only one
type of force, and it was attraction. Because there is only one type of mass, there
