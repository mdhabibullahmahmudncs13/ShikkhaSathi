Geometric proportions
We have learnt to find the area of a triangular region. Two necessary concepts
of ratio are to be formed from this.
1. If the heights of two triangles are equal, their bases and areas are
proportional.
A D
B a CE d F
Let the bases of the triangles ABC" and DEF be BC = a, EF = d
respectively and the height in both cases be h.
1
Hence, the area of the triangle ABC = 3 x a x h, the area of the triangle DEF
1
=-xdxh
3 xd
Therefore, the area of the triangle ABC": area of the triangle DEF
1 1
=gxaxh:gxdxh=a:d=BC:EF
2. If the bases of two triangles are equal, their heights and areas are
proportional.
A D
B roy c EQ b F
Let the heights of the triangles ABC and DEF be AP = h, DQ = krespectively
and the base in both cases be b.
