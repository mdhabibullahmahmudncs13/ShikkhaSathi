246 Physics
If the first medium is air then taking n =1, (Figure 9.02)
we can write _ sing
Ny =—-+
sin 6,
As the value of n, is greater than 1, 6, < 6, i.c after refraction, the ray of light
will bend towards the normal . We say the medium is denser if the value of n is
greater . We are not calling the medium denser due to its mass . Here the
meaning of a denser medium the that the value of n is more . Therefore,
according to the second law of refraction, when a ray of light enters from a rarer
medium to a denser medium, the refracted ray bends towards the normal. When
it enters from a denser medium to a rarer medium, it goes away from the normal
(Figure 9.02). Remember that refractive index of a medium has no direct relation
with density of that medium.
