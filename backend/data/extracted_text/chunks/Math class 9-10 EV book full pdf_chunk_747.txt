========================================

CD _ oe im 60° — 40 x V3 _
Se = smo or, C'D = AC'sin 60 = 40x = =20V3 as d

AD 1 5 so a P
and — = cos 60° or, AD = AC'cos 60° = 40 x — = 20
AC 2

Again, from right-angled triangle BC'D we get,
BC? = BD? + CD? = (BA+ AD)* + CD?
= (50 + 20) + (20/3)? = 4900 + 1200 = 6100
BC = 178.1 (approx.)
The required distance is 78.1 km (approx.)
Example 7. Consider the diagram given and —

1) Find the length of the side BC.

2) Find the value of BD?

3) Find the ratio of areas of AABD and ABCD. E

Chapter 16. Mensuration 325
Solution:

1) AB=15 AC =25 a
BC = AC? — AB? = /(25)% — (15)? = /400 = 20

2) Area of AABC = 1BC -AB = JAC -BD D
