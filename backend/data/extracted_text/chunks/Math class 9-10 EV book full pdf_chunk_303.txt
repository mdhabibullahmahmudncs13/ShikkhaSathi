1. Mathematical Induction

2. Mathematical Deduction

3. Proof by contradiction etc.
Proof by contradiction
Philosopher Aristotle first introduced this method of logical proof. The basis of
this method is:

1. A property cannot be accepted and rejected at the same time.

2. The same object cannot possess opposite properties.

3. One cannot think of anything which is contradictory to itself.

4. If an object attains some property, that object cannot unattain that property

at the same time.
