The rainstorm was becoming more intense. Outside the wind roared and
raindrops splashed against the window panes. The wind rattled the windows
and slammed the shutters against the front of the house. Water began to drip
from the living-rcom ceiling in big noisy splashes. Then a loud burst of thunder
vibrated the house and made everybody jump. Five year old Rima hid her face
in her mother’s lap and began to cry.
