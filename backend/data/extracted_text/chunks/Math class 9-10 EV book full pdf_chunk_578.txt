Chapter 12. Simple Simultaneous Equations in Two Variables 249
Example 3. Solve by the method of elimination:
2r+y=28
3r—-2y=5
Note: To show the difference between the methods of substitution and
elimination, same equations of example 2 have been taken in this example 3.
Solution: Given equations are:
2 +y=58...(1)
3r—2y=5...(2)
Multiplying both sides of equation (1) by 2, 4a + 2y = 16... (3)
Adding (2) and (3),
Tr =21
or,r=23
Putting the value of z in (1) we get,
2x34+y=28
or,y=8—6
or, y=2
.-. solution (x,y) = (3,2)
Elimination method: Conveniently one equation or both equations are
multiplied by such a number so that after multiplication, absolute values of the
coefficients of the same variable become equal. Then as per need, if the
