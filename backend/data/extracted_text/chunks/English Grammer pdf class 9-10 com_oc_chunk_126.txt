========================================

The Past Perfect Continuous
A Read the following text.
Habib made the following entries in his diary last Monday. Read them.
11am Nargis left Dhaka for Sylhet by car.
11.15 | reached her house fifteen minutes late.
1.30 | called her on cell phone. She was near Ashuganj.
6.00 She reached Sylhet and called me.
7.30 | spoke to her again. She was cooking dinner.
Now see how Habib reported the whole thing to Salma a few days later.
When | reached Nargis’ house at 11.15, she had already left home for Sylhet.
She had waited for me till 11.00 and then left with her father in their family
car. When | talked to her at 1.30 pm, she hadn't yet reached Ashuganj, but was
close to it. At 6.00 she called to say that she had just reached Sylhet.
