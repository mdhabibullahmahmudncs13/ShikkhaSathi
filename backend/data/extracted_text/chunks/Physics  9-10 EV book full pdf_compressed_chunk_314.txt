========================================

F=mg
and W=mgh
We have to remember that the weight of the stone is a force and it acts
downwards. We have to apply an upward force equal to the weight of the stone
if we want to lift it.
Potential energy is stored in a stone of mass m by raising it a distance of 4. What
amount of kinetic energy will be generated in the stone if it is released and
comes down by a distance 4?
Due to the conservation of energy total of its potential energy will transform into
kinetic energy. We know kinetic energy ism, SO we can write:

z m= mgh
Vvi=2gh
Honestly we can say, when we were deducing the laws of falling bodies,
we deduced this identical law once again! Now we deduced the same law using the
conception of energy quite in a different way!
