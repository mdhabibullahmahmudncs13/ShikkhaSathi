========================================

force. The force of gravitation and the electromagnetic force can act from any
distance but this force acts for very small distance (10 m). The emission of beta
(B) rays or electrons from a radioactive nucleus is due to this weak nuclear force.
3.2.4 Strong Nuclear Force
This is the strongest force of the universe; this is hundred times stronger than the
electromagnetic force but this too acts at a very small distance (10° m).
We know the nucleus is situated at the centre of the atom and the strong force
acting between the protons and the neutrons within the nucleus confines them.
Confined due to this strong nuclear force, the nucleus contains an enormous
amount of energy. Therefore by the division of a large nucleus or by the addition
