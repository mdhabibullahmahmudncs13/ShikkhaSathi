Figure 1.06: Vernier scale displaced by one, two and three divisions
Instead of the vernier scale we can use a special type of scale called a screw
gauge to measure lengths. In a screw gauge when the screw (Figure 1.07)
rotates, the scale moves forwards or backwards, the threads of the screw are kept
very fine. After a complete rotation of the screw, the screw with the attached
scale may advanced by Imm. This displacement of the screw is called the pitch of
the screw. The circular part of the instrument, by the rotation of which the screw
moves forwards or backwards is divided into 100 equal parts. For the rotation of
only one division of the circular scale, the screw advances by = of the pitch.
