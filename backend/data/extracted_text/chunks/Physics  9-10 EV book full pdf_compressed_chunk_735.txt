Static Electricity 273
Normally atoms are charge neutral and that means there are an equal number of
electrons and protons in an atom. But if an electron is removed from the
outermost orbit, then the number of protons is more than the electrons and the
atom is not electrically neutral anymore, the amount of positive charge within it
increases. If one electron is removed, one positive charge is developed in the
atom, if two electrons are removed,

two positive charges are developed.

We then say that the atom has been

ionized or charged. As an atom is Electron

positively ionized, it can also be YY @

negatively ionized or charged. That ® o 2)

is, when one or more isolated O o. 2

electrons are attached to an atom,
