========================================

Keep an eye on the content rather than the mechanical calculation of sentences. Assess
the paragraph from different aspects such as grammar, ideas, organisation of
ideas, communication, punctuation, and spelling. Do not assess the paragraph from
the perspective of grammar accuracy only. Regarding the composition writing in Paper
2 (which is structurally an essay) the word limit will be 250 for classes 6-7, 300 for
class 8, and 350 for 9-10.
