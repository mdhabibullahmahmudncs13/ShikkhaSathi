11.6 Design of Circuit in Residence
What a circuit should be like for supplying electricity in a household is shown
in Figure 11.17. Electricity is supplied at home from a power station through a
supply cable. Between them, one is live; another is neutral. The live line has high
voltage, the neutral has zero voltage. The live line is marked red and the neutral
line is marked blue in the figure. It first passes through an electric meter. This
meter records how much electricity is consumed. After the meter, it is supplied
through a consumer unit.
