196 Physics
When we produce a wave in the rope by shaking it, there the vibration of the
rope does not take place along the direction of the velocity of the wave. The
direction of vibration i.e. up and down of the rope, is perpendicular to the
direction of the velocity of the wave. The name of this type of a wave is a
transverse wave. The wave produced in water is an example.
