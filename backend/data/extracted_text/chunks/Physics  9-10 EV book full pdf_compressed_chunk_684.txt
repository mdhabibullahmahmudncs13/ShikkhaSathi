Refraction of light 251
ted . If you have a prism then you will be able to
see total internal reflection with your own eyes. In Figure 9.07, at the glass-air
separating surface the incident angle is 45° ,which is greater than the critical
angle 41.8° of glass-air. Therefore total internal reflection will occur here.
Example

Question : What will happen if you want to do this experiment under
water ? (n, for glass is 1.52 and n, for water is 1.33)
Answer: In water B= 0.88 therefore the critical angle of glass will be 61.6°
because sin 61.6° =0.88
or sin(0.88) = 61.6"
As the angle of incidence is 45° , which is less than the critical angle 61.6", total
internal reflection will not occur.
Question : Light incidents at an angle of
75° from a medium of refractive index |
