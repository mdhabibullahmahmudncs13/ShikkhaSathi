If the constant of a spring is k, and if the spring is compressed by a
distance x from its normal state, then the potential energy stored in it is,
— 12
V= 3 kx
@ Do Yourself
If a spring is compressed or expanded by an amount x, it will
exert a force of F= -kx, using this equation it is possible to find out the
relation, V = Th? Can you find it? (Since the force depends on the length
of the spring, so calculate the average force and multiply it by the total
distance.)
0) Example
Question: A body of mass 10 kg falls on a spring with a velocity of 10 m/s. If
the spring constant k=100,000 J/m?, what is the compression?
Answer: Kinetic energy of the object,
1 210x102 = 500
3 mv = 2 ]= ]
This energy will compress the spring, that is,
! kx? = 500
