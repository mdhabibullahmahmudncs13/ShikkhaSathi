Refraction of light 265
closer
Example
side twice of its focal length, then a real image
of the object is formed. If the object is kept at the position of the image, then where
will the image be formed?
Answer: If the direction of the light ray is changed, then one is converted to another.
Do Yourself
If the light from a distant object falls on a lens, then it forms its image on
the focal point of the lens. Using this process you can find the focal length of
a convex lens. In order to do it you should move the lens forward and
backward until a distinct image is formed on the wall. When the image is
distinct, then measure the distance from the lens to the wall. This is the focal
length of this lens.
