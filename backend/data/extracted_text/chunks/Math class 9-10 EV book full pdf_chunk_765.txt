332 Mathematics Classes IX-X
or, 1600 — 80x + 169 = 1369 [From (1)]
or, 1600 + 169 — 1369 = 80x
or, 80x =400 ;. x =5
Now putting the value of z in equation(1) we get,
524 h? = 169 or, h* = 169 — 25 = 144 ~ h = 12

Area of the trapezium ABCD = 348 +CD)-h

= 701 +51) x 12 square cm = 71 x 12 square cm = 852 square cm
The required area is 852 square cm.
Area of regular polygon
The lengths of all sides of a regular polygon are equal. Again, the angles are
also equal. Regular polygon with n sides produces n isosceles triangles by adding
centre to the vertices.
So, area of the regular polygon = nx area of one triangular region
ABCDEF --- is a regular polygon whose centre is
O. It has n sides and the length of cach side is a. D
We join O, A:and O, B. E
