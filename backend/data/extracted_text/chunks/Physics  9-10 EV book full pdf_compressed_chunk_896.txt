12.3 Electromagnetic Induction

We see a lot of machines that rotates around us, it may seem to us that this is the
magnet and the biggest contribution of the magnetic field! Actually the biggest
contribution of magnets and magnetic fields is electromagnetic induction, that
is, the production of electricity with the help of magnetic fields.

Scientist Oersted first showed that if the magnetic field is changed through a
conducting loop, then an electromotive force is developed within the loop,
which can flow current through the loop. This property is used to build an
electric generator, where by changing the magnetic field through a conducting
loop, generates eleetricity.

If the two ends of a coil are connected

with an ammeter and a bar magnet is =H
