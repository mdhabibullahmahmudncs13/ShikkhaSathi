========================================

Step 5. From steps (3) and (4),

ZBOD + ZC0D = 2/BA0O +2/C AO [by adding]
This is the same as ZBOC = 2/BAC (Proved)

We can state the theorem in a different way. The angle standing on an arc of the

circle is half the angle subtended by the arc at the centre.

‘Work: Prove the theorem 20 when AC passes through the centre O of the
circle ABC.

Theorem 21. Angles in a circle standing on the same arc are equal.

A E

Let O be the centre of a circle and standing on the

arc BOD, ZBAD and ZBED be the two angles in

the circle. We need to prove that ZBAD = ZBED.
