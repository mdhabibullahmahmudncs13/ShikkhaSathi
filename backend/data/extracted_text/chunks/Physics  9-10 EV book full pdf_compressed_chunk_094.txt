Physical Quantities and Their Measurements 27
Therefore, the relative error = 21 cm? /100 cm? = 0.21
In percentage, 0.21 x 100 = 21%
If the error in the measurement of the length is 10%, then in the case of area
it will be approximately double. Similarly you can show that in the case
of volume measurements the error will be three times!
Question: You have measured a box by a ruler which is graduated only in cm.
You have got the length, breadth and height of the box as 10 cm, 5 cm and 4 cm
respectively. What is the percentage of error in your measurements?
Answer: Since your ruler is graduated only in cm, so your error is + 0.5 cm.
Therefore the error in your measurements:
Length: 10 + 0.5 cm
Breadth: 54 0.5 cm
Height: 4 + 0.5 cm
