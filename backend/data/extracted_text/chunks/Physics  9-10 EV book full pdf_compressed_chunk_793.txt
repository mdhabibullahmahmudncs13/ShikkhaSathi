Mathematical questions
1. 4C and -1C charges are kept 1 m apart. At which point of the line joining
them, is the magnitude of the electric field zero?
2. An electron in a hydrogen atom revolves around the nucleus due to Coulomb’s
force. The mass of electron is 9.11x10*! kg and proton is 1.67x10?” kg and for
this there is also a gravitational force between them. Which of these two forces
is greater and by how much?
3. Draw the electric lines of force for the two charges mentioned in question
number 1.
4. Equipotential lines for opposite charges are shown in Figure 10.15, show
electric field from there.
5. Electric field for two charges is shown in Figure 10.13, draw the potential.
Choose the correct answer
1. The name of the apparatus used to determine the presence of charge is —
