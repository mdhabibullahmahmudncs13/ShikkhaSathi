========================================

continues to boil at a high temperature. As |
the temperature is high, cooking will be |
done faster. -
If pressure is applied, the melting point of a Figure 6.09: It is possible to cut a
gas increases. So without too much cooling, ice bar by pressing with a fine wire.
a gas can be liquefied by increasing
pressure. Then a lot of heat is produced, which has to be taken out properly.
