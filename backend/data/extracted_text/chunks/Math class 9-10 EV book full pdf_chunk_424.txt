========================================

to a straight line, the perpendicular is the shortest] (Proved)
Corollary 8. At any point on a circle, only one tangent can be drawn.
Corollary 9. The perpendicular to a tangent at its point of contact passes
through the centre of the circle.
Corollary 10. At any point of the circle the perpendicular to the radius is a
tangent to the circle.
Theorem 26. If two tangents are drawn to a circle from an external point, the
distances from that point to the points of contact are equal.
B
Let P be a point outside a circle ABC with centre O
and two line segments PA and PB be two tangents Pp
to the circle at points A and B. It is required to prove
that, PA = PB A c
Drawing: Join O, 4; O, B and O, P.
Proof:
Step 1. Since PA is a tangent and OA is the radius through the point of tangent,
PA LOA
