3. A force of 10 N acts on a stationary object of mass 10 kg. After 10s a
force of 20 N acts on it for 5 s in the opposite direction. What is the
distance traveled by the object?

4. You have jumped from a boat with a velocity of 10 m/s towards the bank.
Your mass and the mass of the boat are 50 kg and 100 kg respectively. In

which direction and with what velocity will the boat move?

5. The coefficient of friction pu of a wooden piece on a floor is 0.01. If the
mass of the wooden piece is 10 kg, what is the force required in moving
it? If a stone of mass 100 kg is kept on the wooden block, what is force
required to move it? What happens if the floor is frictionless?
