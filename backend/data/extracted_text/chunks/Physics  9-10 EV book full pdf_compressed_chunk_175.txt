========================================

the first stationary object, you start to count time with a watch, or start
counting “one thousand one”, “one thousand two” and so on. Again when
you will see this vehicle just passing the second stationary object, you
see the time on the watch or stop counting the numbers. Find the required
time from the watch or up to which number of words you have counted,
This is the time to travel the distance.
Calculate the speed dividing the distance by the time.
Discussion: Compose your procedure of measuring time with the time of
a watch and see how accurate is it. Guess the percentage of error of your
calculated speed considering the degree of accuracy of your step
measuring procedure.
