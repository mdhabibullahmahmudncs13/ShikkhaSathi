========================================

its direction of motion; it will move along a straight line at uniform speed.)
The first part of Newton’s first law is not difficult to understand because we
always observe that the bodies at rest remain at rest and do not move until they
are pushed. The problem arises from the second part, because we never observe that
a body in motion keeps its perpetual motion for ever. If motion is produced in a
body by pushing it, we observe that the body comes to rest if no force is applied.
From our daily life experiences it seems that to keep a body in uniform motion
we have to apply force on it continuously. Form Newton's first law we learnt
that it is not true. If a body in uniform velocity stops then we have to realize that
