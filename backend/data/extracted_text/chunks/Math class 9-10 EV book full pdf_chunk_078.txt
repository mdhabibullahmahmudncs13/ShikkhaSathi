========================================

to be universal set with respect to sets under discussion.
Usually universal set is denoted by U. However, other symbols can also be used
to denote universal set. For example, if set of all even natural numbers is C' =
{2,4,6,...} and set of all natural numbers is N = {1,2,3,4,5.6,...}, then N will
be universal set with respect to the set C.
Complement of a Set
Let U be universal set and A be a subset of U
U. Then the set of elements outside of A is
termed as complementary set of A. The Ac
complementary set of A is denoted by A or
A’. Mathematically, A° =U \ A.
Let, P and @ be two sets. Then the elements of P that are not elements of Q
are said to form the complementary set of P with respect to @, and is written
=P\Q
Example 7. If U = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, A = {2,4,6,7} and B = {1,3,5}, then
