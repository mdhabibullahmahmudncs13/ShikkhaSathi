========================================

Postulate 2: For two different points there exists one and only one straight line,
on which both the points lie.
Postulate 3: For three points which are not colinear, there exists one and only
one plane, on which all the three points lie.
Postulate 4: A straight line passing through two different points on a plane lie
completely in the plane.
Postulate 5:
1) Space contains more than one plane.
2) In each plane more than one straight lines lie.
3) The points on a straight line and the real numbers can be related in such a
way that every point on the line corresponds to a unique real number and
conversely every real number corresponds to a unique point of the line. Nn
