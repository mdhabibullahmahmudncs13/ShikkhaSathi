VES Doms
We can use this velocity as data for the time 1.5 s within 1 to 2s. Similarly
we see the average velocity between 2 s and 3 s is 5 m/s, between 3 and 4 s
is 7 m/s and between 4 s and 5 s is 9 m/s. We see these data points are on a
straight line on a graph paper and we can connect the points by drawing a
straight line. Although we have put the data for time 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5
s, but we can find the velocity at any time after drawing a straight line
through these points. For example at time 3 s the velocity is 6 m/s.
We will be able to find the acceleration in the same way after drawing the
velocity -time graph of figure 2.09. Acceleration is the rate of change of
velocity. Since the velocity- time graph is a straight line, so in this case we
