ax + boy =o (infinite)

(tii) ayx + by = 2-1 # 2 | inconsistent independent| no
as by" oe
arr + boy = cy
Now, if there is no constant termsin both the equations of a system of equations
ie ¢; = cy = 0, then from the table:
a b
According to (i) if en I" the system of equations is always consistent and
az 2
independent of each other. In that case, there will be only one (unique) solution.
