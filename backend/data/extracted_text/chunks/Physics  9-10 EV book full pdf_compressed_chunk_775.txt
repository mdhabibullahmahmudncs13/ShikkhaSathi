to as a capacitor. A capacitor with high capacitance requires a large amount of
charge to produce only a small increase in potential, while a capacitor with low
capacitance will see a significant rise in potential with just a small amount of
charge. For example, if a spherical capacitor has a capacitance C and receives a
charge Q, then its potential V is given by:
