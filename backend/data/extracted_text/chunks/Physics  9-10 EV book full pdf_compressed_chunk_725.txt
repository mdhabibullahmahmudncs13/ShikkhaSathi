Refraction of light 267
Exercise
General questions
1. The velocity of light in a denser medium is less. Is there anything which can
go with the velocity greater than the velocity of light?
2. At noon why is rainbow not seen ?
3. Drops of water can work like a lens. What is focal length of this lens ?
Mathematical questions
Figure 9.32: Total reflection angle will be changed if liquid drops of different
refractive index are placed on the point of incidence.
1. If a ray of light passes through glass
having shape shown in Figure 9.32, then
the critical angle of total internal
reflection 65° is found. Due to a drop of x
liquid at the point of incidence, total
internal reflection happened at angle YF
75°. What is the refractive index of the
liquid.
