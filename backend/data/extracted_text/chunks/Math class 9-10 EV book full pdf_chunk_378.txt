Cut RQ = p from any ray RX. Draw 348 = ZFERX at the point R and
1
draw 54C = ZFQR at the point Q. FR and FQ intersect each other at
1 1
the point A. Now draw ZRAB = 348 and ZQAC = 54C at the point A
where ZERX of the side ER and ZFQR of the side FQ lie, respectively.
The line segment AB and AC intersect at the point B and C' of the line
RQ.
ABC is the required triangle.

Cut BA = 37 from any ray BX. Draw
ZABE = 60° at the point B. Take D
BC = AB from BE. centring the point Cc
A and C, draw two arcs of equal radius
