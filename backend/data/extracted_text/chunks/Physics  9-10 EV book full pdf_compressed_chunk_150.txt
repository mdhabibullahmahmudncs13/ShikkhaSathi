========================================

a given time (7) is directly proportional to that time. i.e.v oc t

Third law: The distance (/) traversed by a freely falling body from rest in a

given time (7) is directly proportional to the square of the given time. i.e.

We have mentioned earlier that the acceleration due to gravity is an example of
uniform acceleration. The equations we have deduced about motion, can be used
to deduce the equations of motion of the falling bodies. In case motion s was used
to indicate the travelled distance, for a falling body we will use h to indicate height.
For acceleration we will use g instead of a. These two will be the only difference!

v=u+ gt

= 1 2

h=ut+ 3 gt
