Simplification of Algebraic Fractions
Simplification of algebraic fractions means to transform two or more
fractions associated with operational signs into one fraction or expression. Here,
the obtained fraction is to be expressed in its lowest terms.
Example 12. Simplify: _ 4, b
a+b a—p
Solution: _ 9, b _ax(a-b)+bx(a+b) _ a’ —ab+ab+b*
a+b a—b (a+b)(a—-b) (a+b)a-b)
_a+b
a’ -b’
Example 13. Simplify: XY _Y*Z
xy yz
Solution : XTY _ YZ _ zx(x+y)—xx(y+z) _ zx+zy—xy—xz
xy yz xyz xyz
_yz—xy _y(z—Xx) _z-x i
xyz xyz xz
