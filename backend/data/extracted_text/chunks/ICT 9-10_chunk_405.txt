========================================

Now consider the following examples
x=innl} # the value of x willbe | |= foat(l}  #the valisofxwill be 10 | x= sts 1") she value of x will be 51!
y= int(2.8) # the value of y will be 2 | y = float{2.8) # the value of y will be 2.8 y=stn2) whe valve of y will be 2
= ink("3") # the value of y will be 3 |= Daak'3") othe valué of zvall 5630 | z= (3.00 % the value of 2 will be 5.0
= flo '4.2") # the waite of w wil be 4.2
