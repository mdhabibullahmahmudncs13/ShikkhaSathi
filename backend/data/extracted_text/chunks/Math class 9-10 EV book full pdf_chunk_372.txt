Drawing: [rom any ray AE, cut the
line segment AC' equal to a. Bisect the P
line segment AC to find the mid-point O. ; B,
At O construct the angle ZAOP equal ASN
to ‘x and extend the ray OP to the A A LE
opposite ray OQ. From the rays OF and Ra D
OQ cut two line segments OB and OD
1
equal to 7b Join A, B; A, D; C', B and [e}
Cc, D.
Then, ABCD is the required parallelogram.
Proof: In AAOB and ACOD,
0A = 0C = 1 OB = OD = 1, [by construction]

and included ZAOB = included ZCOD [opposite angle]
Therefore, ANAOB = ACOD
So, AB =CD
mp and ZABO = ZC DO; but the two angles are alternate angles.
AB and C'D are parallel and equal.
Similarly, AD and BC are parallel and equal.
Therefore, ABCD is a parallelogram with diagonals
