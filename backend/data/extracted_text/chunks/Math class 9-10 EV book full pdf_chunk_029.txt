Chapter 1. Real Numbers 9

o The repeating decimal fraction has been multiplied with a number equalling
1 followed by as many 0s as many nonrepeating digits are there in the
repeating decimal fraction.

may be noted that nonrepeating part has been subtracted from the repeating
decimal fraction by deleting decimal point and repeating point.

e The result of subtraction has been divided by a number equalling as many
9s as many repeating digits were there in the original repeating decimal
fraction, followed by as many Os as there were nonsepeating digits after
decimal point.
