========================================

{b}, @ are subsets of set A. All the sets that can be formed from a set are called
subsets of the original set. Subset is denoted by C. If B is a subset of A, then we
write B C A. B is a subset of A. Among the subsets above {a,b} is equal to set
A. Each set is the subset of itself. again @ in formed from any set. . @ is a subset
of any set.
Let P= {1,2,3} and Q = {2,3}, R = {1.3}, then P, Q and R are subsets of P.
That is, PC P,Q C P and RC P.
