iii) If any magnet is rotated around a motionless wire coil
Which one is correct of the following?
(a)i (b)ii (c)iandii (d) ii and iii
A bar magnet is moving to and fro through a coil of wire. As a result, voltage is
induced in the coil. The induced voltage depends on some factors. Now,
answer questions number 4 and 5.
4. In case of electromagnetic induction, the induced voltage depends on which
of the following?
(i) Intensity of the magnetic field
(ii) Resistance of the coil moving in the magnetic field
(iii) Speed of the coil moving in the magnetic field.
Which one of the following is correct?
(a)i (b)ii (c)iandii (d) ii and iii
