But we don’t want to express the law in proportional form, rather we want to
write it as an equation.
In that case, using a proportionality constant k, we can write
F = kma
In case of Newton's second law it is possible to create an amazing result. Since
the term ‘force’ is not explained anywhere, (Newton's first law gives the concept
only) by using the second law this will be measured for the first time. So, we
have to give a value for the constant. We can say, when Newton's second law
will be applied, if the proportionality constant is considered as 1, then the
equation we will get is the measure of force. How easily a proportionality
relation is converted into an equation.
Therefore, we can write Newton's second law of motion as an equation. If the
