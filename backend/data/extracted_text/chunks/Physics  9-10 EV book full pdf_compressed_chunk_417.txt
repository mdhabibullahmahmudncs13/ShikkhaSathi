========================================

Im? on the earth surface, then the weight of the column of air on it is 10°N, this
is approximately the weight of an elephant !
Here, you have to understand something very clearly. It is true, weight is a force
and this force acts downwards. Force is a vector, so it has both magnitude and
direction. Pressure is not a vector, it has no
direction, so it is same in all directions at any
place. The place where you are standing or sitting
now, the pressure which air exerts on you is the Air coli
same in left , right , up, down or in all directions. <>
It is true for air or liquid for all times.
If an air-tight casket made of thin tin or
aluminum can be made airless in any way, then it
will be folded or twisted, because in normal
condition, the outer air pressure was balanced by k 4
