========================================

Example

Question: Show that, triangle OPX R
and OPX' are congruent. A
Answer: Here, Z XPO = «/X'PO
because both of them are at right N 8 0
angles, as XP is normal to the plane. 8 cH
According to the law of reflection, LY
incident angle is equal to angle of P He .
reflection, therefore, XOP =ZROA. : eee MN
Again ZROA =Z X'OP. B
Therefore, between triangle OPX and
OPX’, OP is the common arm and two i .
angles on both sides are equal. So, Figure 8.09: Two light rays xP and
triangles are congruent XO are sufficient to draw an image
Therefore, XP = XP. of the object at position X
The image we see in a mirror is not actually real even though it seems real. This -
is because light is not actually coming from the place it appears to be coming. g
