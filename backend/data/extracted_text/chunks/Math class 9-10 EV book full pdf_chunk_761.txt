.. Area of the parallelogram = dh square cm.
. 120 120
As per question, dh = 120 or, h = rT 5
The required length of the perpendicular is 5 cm.
Example 12. The length of the sides of a parallelogram are wetre and 8 metre
If the length of the smaller diagonal is 10 m, determine the length of the other diagonal.
Solution: » ¢
Let, in the parallelogram ABCD; AB = a = 12 metre
and AD = c¢ = 8 metre and diagonal BD = b = 10 . No
metre Let us draw the perpendiculars DF and CE RN
from D and C' on AB and the extended part of AB 1]
respectively. Join C', A and D, B. AF vB FE

.". Semi perrimeter of AABD, s = Zr0+d metre = 15 metre.
area of AABD=1/s(s — a)(s — b)(s — ¢) = \/15(15 — 12)(15 — 10)(15 — 8) sq.
