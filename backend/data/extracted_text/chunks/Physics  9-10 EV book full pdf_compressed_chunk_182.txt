1. Rajib with his family members started for Jaflong in Sylhet by
microbus.He recorded the magnitude of the velocity i.e. speed of the car from
the speedometer after every Smins throughout the journey. The magnitude of
velocity he got per hour was 18,36,54,54,54,36, and 18 kilometer.
(a) What is instantaneous speed?
(b) Explain the acceleration of an object moving with uniform velocity.
(c) Find the distance traveled by the car in the first Smin.
(d) Draw and explain the velocity-time graph from the collected data.
2. An object of mass m is moving with an acceleration a. Its initial velocity is u,
final velocity v and the distance travelled in time 7 is s. The state of motion of the
object is given in the table:
