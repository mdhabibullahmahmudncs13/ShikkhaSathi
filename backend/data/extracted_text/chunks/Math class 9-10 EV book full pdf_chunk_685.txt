Drawing: Consider the matching sides of the triangles ABC and DEF unequal.
Take two points P and @ on AB and AC respectively so that AP = DE and
AQ = DF. Join P and @Q and complete the drawing.

Proof:

Step 1. In AAPQ and ADEF

AP=DE,AQ=DF,/A = /D Therefore, AAPQ = ADEF [SAS theorem]

Therefore, ZAPQ = ZDEF = ZABC and ZAQP = Z/DFE = ZACB.

That is, the corresponding angles produced as a result of intersections of

AB and AC by the line segment PQ are equal.

Therefore PQ || BC cL 2 = = or, — = 2 [corollary 1]
Step 2. Similarly, cutting line segments ED and EF from BA and BC

respectively, it can be shown that,

BA BC

ED = GF [theorem 28]
