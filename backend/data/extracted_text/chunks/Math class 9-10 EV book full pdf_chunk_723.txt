========================================

and hypotenuse is AB. It is to be proved that, c
) ) K
AB? = BC? + AC? F A
Drawing: Draw three squares ABED, ACGF NA %
and BCHK on the external sides of AB, AC
and BC respectively. Through C', draw the line
segment CL parallel to AD or BE. Let CL D a r
intersects AB at M and DE at L respectively.
Join C, D and B, F.
Proof:
Step 1. In ACAD and ABAF, CA = AF, AD = AB and included ZCAD =
LCAB+£BAD = LCAB+/CAF = included ZBAF [£BAD = LCAF =
1 right angle]
Therefore, ACAD = ABAF
