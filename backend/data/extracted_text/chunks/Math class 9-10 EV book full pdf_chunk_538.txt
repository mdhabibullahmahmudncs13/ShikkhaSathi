Chapter 11. Algebraic Ratio and Proportion 235
2: 3; Soni’s earning : Samir’s earning = 1500 : 2500 = 3 : 5. Hence, Ronis :
Soni’s : Sami’s earning = 2:3: 5.
If two ratios are of the form a : b and b : ¢, they can be re-written in the form
a:b:c This is called continued ratio. Any two or more ratios can be expressed
in this form. It is noted that if two ratios are to be expressed in the form a:b: ¢,
the antecedent of the first ratio and the subsequent of the second ratio need to be
equal. For example, if two ratios 2 : 3 and 4 : 3 are to be put in the form a : b: ¢,
the subsequent quantity of the first ratio is to be made equal to the antecedent
quantity of the second ratio. That is, those quantities are to be made equal to
their L.C.M.
Here, L.C.M of 3 and 4 is 12.
