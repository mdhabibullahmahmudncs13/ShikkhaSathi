come from A and B respectively. The first ray has come to point X and the
second one has come to another point Y. The ray coming to point X will be
reflected back the way it has come. Let us extend this ray to the center of the
sphere, O. We can see that OX=r (radius of the sphere). The ray coming from
point B to point Y will create an angle of incidence Oiwith perpendicular
ON at that point. The angle of

reflection of the ray BY is 0,and it will ¢ oo

be reflected towards YP. If we extend Pau 5
PY, it would intersect line OX at point x Y

F. a e = A
FO=FY because in the triangle OFY,

ZFOY=Z0YF , as FOY= 0; and

ZFYO=6,.

FY = FX when XY is small compared
