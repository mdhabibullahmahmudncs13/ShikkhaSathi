========================================

secondary coilis found from conservation of electrical power.
Vp np
hence, Ve Ip = Vs Is ~~ SO,Is = 7) Ip = (2) Is
The transformer has a greater number of turns in the secondary coil than the
primary coil and due to this, the AC voltage applied in the primary coil increases
in the secondary coil is called a step-up transformer. For transmission of
electricity, a step up transformer is used to increase the voltage by many times.
The transformer which has less turns in the secondary coil than the primary coil
and due to this, the AC voltage applied in the primary coil decreases in the
secondary coil. This is called a step down transformer.
Example
Question: The number of turns in the primary coil of a transformer is 100 and
