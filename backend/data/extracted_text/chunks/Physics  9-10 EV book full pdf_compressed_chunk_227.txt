========================================

proportional to the applied force acting on it and the change of
momentum also takes place in the direction in which the force acts.
If a body is moving with an initial velocity u and the velocity is changed (by
increasing or decreasing) from u to v after a time 7.
The change of momentum:
mv-mu
So, the rate of change of momentum:
mv — mu v—u)
———=m—=ma
t t
Since, we considered that there is no change of mass, so we can write like this.
Further we know that acceleration is:
v—u
a=—
Therefore if the applied force is F, then we can write Newton's second law of
motion as:
