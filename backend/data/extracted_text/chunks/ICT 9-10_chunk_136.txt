========================================

You should remember that every moment of your life is valuable, and it is
unwise to spend these moments for any addiction.

Piracy
The objective of copyright law is to provide the writers, artists, and others with
the exclusive right to their creative work. Usually it is expensive and difficult to
reprint any book by violating the copyright law, but now it is easy to make
‘copy’ or ‘facsimile’ using computer technology. It is not required to be an
expert for doing the job. Therefore additional measures are taken to protect the
copyright of computer software, graphics, and animation. When the legal right
is violated, they are deprived of their copyright. It is usually called ‘Piracy’ or
‘Software Piracy’.
