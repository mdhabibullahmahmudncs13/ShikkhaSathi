========================================

Apparatus: Ruler.

Working Procedure:

1. To determine the speed of a vehicle, at first you have to measure the
distance between two stationary objects beside a road (e.g. light post, Tree,

shop etc). Measurement of distance very accurately may be complex that’s

why we will use a simple way to do it. At first you have to measure the
distance of your step by a ruler. (Measure the distance of ten steps and -
divide it by ten to make it accurate). s

2. Now walk from one stationary object to another object on road sides.
Count the number of steps you need to travel the distance and
multiply it by the distance of your single step to calculate the distance. It
will be better if the distance is approximately hundred meters.
