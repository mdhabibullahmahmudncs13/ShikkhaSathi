Figure 5.13: (a) solid (b) liquid (c) gas.
The distance among the molecules of a gas are very large. Those substances have
no regular volume and shape. Molecules in a liquid remains closer and they have
a particular volume but no regular shape. In a solid, molecules are very close and
they are almost in contact with each other, so they have a definite volume and a
regular shape.
In a gas, molecule can move freely, in liquids the molecules vibrate, and one can
pass through from one side to the other, in solids though the molecules can
vibrate but they can not change their position.
Normally we cannot see the molecules of solids, liquids or gases, we see it as
