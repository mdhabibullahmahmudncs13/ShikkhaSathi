========================================

direction. The wheels of a bicycle may rotate in the clockwise direction or in the
anticlockwise direction. The rotation in the anticlockwise direction is considered
the positive direction of rotation.
This fixed point around which the object rotates is the centre of rotation. The
angle of turning during rotation is called the angle of rotation. A full-turn means
rotation by 360°; a half-turn is rotation by 180°.
In the figure below, a fan with four blades rotating by 90° is shown in different
positions. It is noted during a complete revolution in four positions (rotating
about the angle by 90°, 180°, 270° and 360°), the fan looks exactly the same. For
this reason, it is said that the rotational symmetry of the fan is order 4.
