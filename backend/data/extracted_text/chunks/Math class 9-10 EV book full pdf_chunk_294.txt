are accepted without any proof. Since the fifth postulate is related to parallel
lines, it will be discussed later.
Plane Geometry
It has been mentioned earlier that point, straight line and plane are three
fundamental concepts of geometry. Although it is not possible to define them
properly, based on our real life experience we have ideas about them. As a
concrete geometrical conception space is regarded as a set of points and straight
lines and planes are considered the subsets of this universal set. That is,
Postulate 1: Space is a set of all points and plane and straight lines are the
sub-sets of this set.
From this postulate we observe that each of plane and straight line is a set and
