Chapter 12. Simple Simultaneous Equations in Two Variables 255
Exercise 12.2
Solve by the method of substitution (1 — 3):
Ty ry
1. Tx —3y=231 2. —4+z=1 3. —+==2
Y 2 + 3 ab
9x — by = 41 a ar + by = a* + b*
32
Solve by the method of elimination(4 — 6):
4. Trx—3y=31 5 Txr—8y=-9 6. ar+by=c
9z — by = 41 Sr —4y =—3 ax + by =
Solve by the method of cross-multiplication (7 — 15):
7. 2e+3y+5=0 8 3x—-5y+9=0 9. r+2y="7
dr +Ty+6=0 Sr —3y—1=0 20 —3y=10
10. 4x +3y =—12 11. —Tx+8y=9 12. 32 —y—-7=0
2r=5 Sx —4dy = 3 2r+y—3=0
13. av+by=a> +0 14. yB+a)=x6+y) 15. (x+2)(y—3)=y(z-1)
2bx — ay = ab 3(3+x)=5(y—1) Sz —1ly—8=0
Solving by using Graphical Method
In a simple equation in two variables, the relation of existing variables x and y
