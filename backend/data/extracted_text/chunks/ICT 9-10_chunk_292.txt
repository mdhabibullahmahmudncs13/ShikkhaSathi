Clustering, Integrating and Segregating Palette

Numerous palettes can be panelled together. For example. Layer, Path and

Channel can stay together. The names of the palette will remain as tabs. The tab

which is clicked will be activated. The combined situation of several palettes is

called clustered palette.

- The present palette is activated as a ‘Layer Palette’. Click the layer tab and
drag it outside the paletie to release. The Layer palette will exist as an
individual or single palette.

- Again clicking the tab of the individual Layer, release another palette
inside by dragging it. Thick lines around the palette will be viewed. Thus
the Layer taken by dragging will be included in the cluster.
