(a) Let us consider you pushed the stone for 2 s, what happens then?
Answer: In 2 s the velocity of the stone will be increased to:
v=u+at=0+05x2m/s =1m/s
Then the stone will move with a uniform velocity of 1 m/s.
In 2 s your velocity will be:
ut+at=0+1x2m/s =2m/s
Then you will move in the reverse direction with a uniform velocity of 2 m/s.
3.9 Frictional force
Earlier we have discussed gravitational force or gravity and spring force. Now
we shall discuss about a totally different type of force, this is frictional force.
Let us consider a wooden piece on
a table and we are trying to create F »
an acceleration by applying a .
force on it. As shown in figure liz d
3.15, we are applying a force F on | fF
the mass from left to right. It will |
