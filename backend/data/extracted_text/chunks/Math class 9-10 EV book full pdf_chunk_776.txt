Measurement regarding circle
1. Circumference of a circle
The length of a circle is called its circumference.
Let r be the radius of a circle, its circumference c
c = 27r, where 7 = 3.14159265--- which is an
irrational number. Value of 7 = 3.1416 is used as
the approximate value. Therefore, if the radius of a
