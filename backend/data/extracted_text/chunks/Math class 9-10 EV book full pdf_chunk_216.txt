Scientific or Standard Form of Numbers
We can express very large numbers or very small numbers easily by using exponents.
Such as, the velocity of light = 300000 km/sec = 300000000 m/sec

= 3 x 100000000 m/sec = 3 x 10% m/sec
Again, the radius of a hydrogen atom

= 0.0000000037 cm

3
= EE em = 37 x 107 cm
10000000000

=3.7x10 x 107" cm = 3.7 x 107 em
For convenience, very large or very small numbers are expressed in the form a x10"
where, 1 < a < 10 and n € Z. The number of the form a x 10" is called the
scientific or standard form of number.

Work: Express the following numbers in scientific form :

1) 15000 2) 0.000512 3) 123.000512
Logarithmic Methods
Logarithmic systems are of two kinds :
