Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 25
But initially, we assumed K as the maximum element of the set N.
Subsequently, it turns out that K+1 is also an element of the set N. Similarly,
it can be shown that K+2, K+3, ... are also elements of the set N.
Therefore, the set of natural numbers N cannot be finite. Hence, the set of
natural numbers is an infinite set.
‘Work: Determine which ones are finite and which ones are infinite sets:

1) {3.57

2) {1,2,22,...21%)

3) (BEF)

4) {x : x integer and x < 4}

5) £ :p and ¢ are mutually coprimes and ¢ > 1}
