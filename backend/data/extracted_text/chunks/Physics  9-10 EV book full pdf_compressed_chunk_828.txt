========================================

temperature rise causes the decrease of resistance of a semiconductor.
11.2.3 Circuit
If we have understood Ohm's law, we should be able to analyse circuits now.
Before that, let us introduce some of the symbols that are used in circuits:
(Figure 11.07)
Every substance has some resistance, but we do not consider the resistance of
electrical wires while using them in circuits in our daily life. When a resistance
is needed, we use different resistances prepared in special ways. Sometimes we
use such resistances for some special purposes, where even their magnitudes
can be changed, these are called variable resistance or rheostat. -
