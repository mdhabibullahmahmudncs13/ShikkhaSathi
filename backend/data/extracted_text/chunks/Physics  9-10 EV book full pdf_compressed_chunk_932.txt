========================================

pt -> n® + é" + v (neutrino)
(This reaction cannot take place outside the nucleus. This is because the mass of
a neutron is more than that of a proton.)
In this process, the number of protons decreases by one and hence the atomic
number also decreases by one, and a nucleus of different element is formed.
Though neutrinos or anti-neutrinos are emitted during beta radiation, they are
not considered to be radioactive rays. This is because they are charge less and
they are so inert (or nonreactive) that even a few light years thick lead sheet
cannot stop a neutrino particle.
13.1.3 Gamma ray
A gamma ray is actually an energetic electromagnetic wave. It has no charge, but
as it is strong, its wavelength is very low (frequency is very high). Regardless of ~~,
