Question: How much charge should be stored in the earth and the moon so that
the gravitational force becomes zero and the moon goes out of its orbit?
Answer: The gravitational force acting between the earth and the moon:
mM
Fo=G—g
Here, G = 6.67 x 107" Nkg?m?
m= 7.35 x 1022 kg
M = 5.97 x 10% kg
7 = 3.84 x 10° km
So, f= 6.67 x 10711 x 7.35 x 1022 x 5.97 x 102* N 1.98 x 10% N
To fe = (3.84 x 105)? =
