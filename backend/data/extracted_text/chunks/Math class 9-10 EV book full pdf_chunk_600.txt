Chapter 12. Simple Simultaneous Equations in Two Variables 259
Solution: Given equations are:
3x —y=3...(1)
Sx+y=21...(2)
From equation (1) we get, 3x —y = 3, or, y = 3x — 3
Taking some values of z in the equation, we find the corresponding values of y
and make the adjoining table:
EEINEE
[y]=6[-3]6]
.-. three points on the graph of the equation are: (—1,—6), (0, —3), (3,6)
Again, from equation (2) we get, bz + y = 21, or, y = 21 — bz
Taking some values of z in the equation, we find the corresponding values of y
and make the adjoining table:
[vy 61] 4]
.-. three points on the graph of the equation are: (3,6), (4,1), (5, —4).
In a graph paper let XOX’ and YOY’ be
respectively the X- axis and Y- axis and O is
the origin.
