Real image is a very important idea. We will find in the next chapter how real
images can be formed with a lens. You have already seen that there are real light
rays in a real image, so if it is projected on a screen, it is possible to see the
image. In ordinary mirrors, you can look at yourself but you cannot project
yourself on screens with ordinary mirrors.
Example

Question: Figure 8.24 shows that the
image of object XY is formed at
X'Y". If the object is X'Y’, where will Q X
the image be formed? it
Answer: This is a real image. So if =
X'Y'’ is an actual object, the image Oy
