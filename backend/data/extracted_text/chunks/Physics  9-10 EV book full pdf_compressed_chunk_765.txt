Static Electricity 287

Therefore, to bring a test charge q from a distance r; along a straight line,
work has to be done against the repulsive force. The closer the charge q, is
brought to charge q, the greater the repulsive force it will feel, and thus more
work must be done. According to Coulomb's law, if the distance between
charges q and q, is infinite, there will be no force acting between them.
If work W is done in bringing an extremely small positive test charge q,, at con-
stant velocity, from an infinite distance to a distance r from the charge q, then
the work done per unit test charge is called the electric potential V of charge q at
that point. The potential is expressed as:
