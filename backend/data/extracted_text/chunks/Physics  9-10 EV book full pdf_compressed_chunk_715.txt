Outside the focal length
Now let’s see what happens if the object is kept outside the focal length. Three
different things can happen in this case, like in a concave mirror. (i) The object
is outside the focal length but inside twice of the focal length. (ii) The object is
outside twice of the focal length and (iii) The object is exactly on the twice of the
focal length. Let’s examine this
one by one. Xx Cc
(i) First, the object will be kept I A

length. In Figure 9.24, the Y “N (
image of the point Y of the IE]
object XY will be on the YO |
line. So, we find the image J
of the point X, as before. f f f Y
