========================================

we use in a circuit, so , we do not consider it at all. We will assume that the wire
has no resistance and the potential is the same over the whole wire.
Now, let us analyse a circuit as shown in figure 1 1.08(a), here, a resistance is
connected to the two terminals of a battery cell with two wires. Since the part CD
is connected to the earth, so we can say that the potential of the lower terminal
of the battery cell is zero. So, the upper terminal of the battery has a potential V
and there is a resistance in part BC, potential difference between two ends of the
resistance is,
V-0=V
If the resistance is R, the current I flowing through it will be,
I 14
“R
So, current I comes out from point A of the battery and enters into point B. We
