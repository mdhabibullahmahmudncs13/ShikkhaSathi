cox = 60.622 (approx.)
.. The required distance of the point on the ground from the foot of the tree is
60.62 metre (approx.).
Work: In the picture, AB is a tree. From the information given in the
picture
A
1) Find the height of the tree. >
2) Find the distance of the point C' on the A
ground from the foot of the tree. PVA ¢

Example 3. A ladder of 18 metre long touches the roof of a wall and makes
an angle of 45° with the horizon. Find the height of the wall.
Solution: Let, the height of the wall AB = h metre, length of ladder AC" =18m
and makes angle ZACB = 45° with the ground.
. AB
From AABC we get, sin/ACB = ac
