========================================

When water vapor rises to form clouds, the negative charges (electrons) created
due to friction between water vapor are stored in the lower altitude clouds. So
naturally a shortage of electrons is developed in the higher clouds making them
positively charged. When a large amount of charge is accumulated in the clouds,
a huge spark is formed inside the clouds to return to neutral state (which we
know as lightning). Sometimes so much charge is accumulated in the clouds that
they ionize the air and literally travels to the ground. We call that a thunderbolt.
A huge amount of charge is brought to the earth during a thunderbolt. It ionizes
the air while travelling through it, so a huge amount of heat, light and sound is
produced, and such amounts of charge can cause serious harm to the places
