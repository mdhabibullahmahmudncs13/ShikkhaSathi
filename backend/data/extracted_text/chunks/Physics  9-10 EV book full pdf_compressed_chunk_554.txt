(ii) Energy can be transferred from
N v= one place to another through waves.
I — The more the energy, the more the
el —_ ETE amplitude of the wave. Energy is
=v proportional to the amplitude of the
wave. If the amplitude is doubled,
JAN energy is increased four times.
(b) av v= (iii) Every wave has a velocity; this
oo velocity depends on the nature of the

refracting through a wire of different cross is 330 m/s, in water this velocity is
