‘We know that,
1) If the length of the rectangular region ABCD B
AB = a units (say, metre), breadth BC' = b units
(say, metre), the area of the region ABCD = ab Aer
square units (say, square metres). » c
\
2) If the length of a side of the square region ABCD, AB B
= a units (say, metre), the area of the region ABCD \
= a? square units (say, square metres). Fara”
When the area of two regions are equal, the c
sign ‘=’ is used between them. For example,
in the figure the area of the rectangular region
ABCD = area of the triangular region AED,
where AB = BE. ! ’ “
It should be mentioned that, if AABC and 4 »
ADEF are congruent, we write AABC =
ADEF. In this case, the arca of the triangular
