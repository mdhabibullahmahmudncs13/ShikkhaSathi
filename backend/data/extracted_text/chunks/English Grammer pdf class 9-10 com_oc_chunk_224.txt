114 English Grammar and Composition
There are adverbs of affirmation and negation in these sentences.
Cc Adverbs may take different positions in a sentence. Look at the
following examples:
The boy is reading loudly.
They were boating downstream.
| am very busy now.
The adverbs of manner, place and time are usually used after the verbs they
modify. Use some other such adverbs in this position.
But an adverb of frequency is usually used between the subject and the verb.
For example:
He always speaks the truth.
It hardly rains here.
They rarely eat together.
He usually comes here in the afternoon.
Adverbs of degree are used before an adjective or adverb. For example:
He is totally mad.
It is raining very hard.
