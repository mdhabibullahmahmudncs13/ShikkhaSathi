========================================

those digits exactly as they are. However, for finding approximation up to certain
decimal places we need to check the next digit. If that digit is 5 or more, 1 should
be added to the last position. Otherwise it will be kept in tact.
Example 20. Find square root of 13, and write down its approximate value up
to 3 decimal places.
Solution:
3) 13 ( 3.605551...
9
66 ) 400
396
7205 ) 40000
36025
72105 ) 397500
360525
721105 ) 3697500
3605525
7211101 ) 9197500
7211101
1986399
the desired square root is 3.605551. .., and desired approximation up to 3
decimal places is 3.606 i.
