Functions oo

Let us consider the relation between A and B: f

For the relation y = x 42 |]

if 2 =1,then y = 3
if + = 2, then y =4 |

if x =3,theny =5

A B

That is, there is exactly one value for y for each value of x and x and y are related
by y = x +2. So two variables x and y are related in such a way that for each
value of x there is exactly one value of y. Then y is said to be a function of x.
Usually function of z is denoted by y, f(z), g(x), F(x).

Let y = 2% — 22 + 3 be a function. Here, for each value of = there is exactly one
value of y. Here, both x and y are variables. Although both of them are variables
value of y depends upon the value of x. That is why x is said to be independent
variable and y dependent variable
