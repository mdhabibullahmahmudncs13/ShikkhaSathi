Appendix 413
Now, multiplying equation (1) by 3 and equation (1) by 4, we get
3412) = 4203)
28x12 =20.........o.....(4)
31x =62 (Adding)

or, x=—

Lx=2
Now, putting the value of Xx in equation (1), we get
2+4y=14
or, 4y=14 -2
or, 4y =12
12
of, y=——

Loy =3.
-. Required solution is (x, y) = (2,3).
Example 7. Solve the following equations :
S5x-3y=9
3x-5y=-1

Solution : The given equations are

5x=3y =n]
3x=5y=—Turn(2)

Multiplying equation (1) by 5 and equation (2) by 3 we get
25x—15y=45...ccccccccece.(3)
9x=15y = 3c (4)
