Observe that in each of the cases above, three parts of a triangle have been
specified. But any three parts do not necessarily specify a unique triangle. As for
example, if three angles are specified, infinite numbers of triangles of different sizes
can be drawn with the specified angles (which are known as similar triangles).

Sometimes for construction of a triangle three such data are provided by which
we can specify the triangle through various drawing. Construction in a few such
cases is stated below.
Construction 1. The base, the base adjacent angle and the sum of other two
sides of a triangle are given. Construct the triangle.
Let the base a, a base adjacent angle Zz and the sum s of the other two sides of
