========================================

3. To keep the earth dynamic which one is necessary? Energy or power?

4. Can mass be considered as energy?

5. If velocity is increased by 1%, what will be the percentage increase of kinetic
energy?

6. A match stick is rubbed with its box with a force of 5 N. The stick is dragged
Sem.
(a) What is the energy used in rubbing?
(b) What is the power needed if it takes 0.5s to drag the stick

7. The reservoir of a hydro-electric project is 800 m high from the sea level and
the power station is 250 m high. The water of a reservoir rotates a turbine
coming through the pipe. There is 20 x 10* liter water in the reservoir. If the
mass of 1 liter water is 1 kg, find the potential energy stored in the water of
the reservoir.
