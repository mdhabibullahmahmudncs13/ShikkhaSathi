========================================

of the liquid, even down the tube. There is no |

leakage above the tube, so air cannot exert 76.cm

pressure through that side. Therefore to i

equalize the pressure there is only a pressure |

under the tube, which is the pressure due to |

the weight of 76 cm mercury column! :

The instrument by which air pressure is —_

measured is called a barometer (Figure:

5.10) and till now the pressure of the air is

measured by a barometer which uses the Figure 5.10: Mercury

process of Torricelli. The height of the becomes stationary just at 76

mercury column becomes more than 76 cm if cm height due to air pressure.

the air pressure increases and if pressure decreases the height become less than

76 cm.
