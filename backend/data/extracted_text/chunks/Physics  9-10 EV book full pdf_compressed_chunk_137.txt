========================================

a string, as in the previous example, and rotated it over your head with uniform
speed then the rotating stone would change its direction of motion continuously.
That is, change of velocity will occur and acceleration will takes place.
If your motion is linear, then there is no scope of changing the direction. Then
acceleration may occur only for the change of magnitude of the velocities
(speed). When the magnitude of the velocity increases, then we can say
positive acceleration is taking place along the direction of the velocity. If the
velocity decreases, then we can say negative acceleration or deceleration is taking
place. Now we can determine the acceleration of an object moving along a
straight line.
