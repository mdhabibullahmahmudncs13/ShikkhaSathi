Equations in One Variable
‘We have known in the previous class what equation is and learnt its usage. We
have also learnt the solution of simple equations with one variable and acquired
knowledge thoroughly about the solution of simple equations by forming
equations from real life problems. In this chapter, linear and quadratic equations
and identities have been discussed and their usages have been shown to solve the
real life problems.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —

» explain the conception of variable.

» explain the difference between equation and identity.

» solve the linear equations.

» solve by forming linear equations based on real life problems.

» solve the quadratic equations and find the solution sets.
