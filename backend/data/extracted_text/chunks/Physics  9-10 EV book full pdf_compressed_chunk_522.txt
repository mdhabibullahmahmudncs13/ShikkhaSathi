========================================

Dryness of air: The drier the air over the liquid surface is, the more the liquid
evaporates.
6.5 Specific Heat
Heat, temperature and the relation between them are discussed so far, however the
amount of heat needed to increase the temperature of an object has not been discussed
yet. You might have noticed that in order to heat some water, it needs to be kept
on the oven for a long time, but approximately the same amount of metal take
little time to be heated at the same temperature. This is because, the specific heat
of a metal is much less compared to water. The amount of heat required to
increase the temperature of a body of mass 1 kg by 1 K is called the specific heat.
That is, if an amount of heat Q is required to increase the temperature from 7’ to
T,, the specific heat will be:
