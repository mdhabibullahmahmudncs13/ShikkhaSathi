6.2.1 Relation among different scales:
A definite temperature is expressed in the Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheits scale
as T, T, and 7 respectively. Then we can write:
T,—0  T¢—27315  Tp—32
100-0  373.15-273.15 212-32
Or,
Te Tq—27315 Tp—32
100 100 180
The readings of Kelvin and Fahrenheit scales with respect to 7, will be respectively:
Te = Tg —273.15°
5 o
Te = 9 (Tp — 32)

Example
Question: At which temperature are the readings in Celsius and Fahrenheit scales
equal?
Answer: The relation between Celsius and Fahrenheit scale is
5
Te = 5 (Ty = 32°)
9Te =5Tp — 5x 32°
If 7. and 7, are equal then we get:
4T¢ = —5 x 32° = —160°
T, = —40°
That is, the temperature which shows - 40° C the same temperature also
shows - 40° F.
