Solution: Let breadth of the rectangular room is = metre.
.. Length of the room is Sa and area 5 Xx = Se
3, 5 5
According to the question, Til = 384 or, 32° = 768 or, 2? = 256
x = 16 metre.

Length of the rectangular room = 5 x 16 = 24 metre and breadth = 16 metre.
oo Its perimeter = 2(24 + 16) metre = 80 metre and length of the diagonal
= V/24% + 16% metre = v/832 metre = 28.84 metre (approx.)
The required perimiter is80 metre and length of the diagonal is 28.84 meter (approx.)
Example 9. The area of a rectangular region is 2000 square meter. If the
length is reduced by 10 metre, it becomes a square region. Find the length and
breadth of the rectangular region.
Solution: Let length of the rectangular region be x metre and breadth y metre.
area of the rectangular region is = xy sq. metre
