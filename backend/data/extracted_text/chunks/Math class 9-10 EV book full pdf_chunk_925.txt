========================================

If two sides of a triangle are equal, then the angles opposite those sides are also

equal.

Special Nomination: Suppose in triangle ABC, AB=AC.

We need to prove that ZABC=ZACB.

Drawing: Draw the bisector of ZBAC as AD such J

that it intersects BC at point D.

Proof: In triangles AABD and AACD:

1) AB=AC (Given) B 5 c

2) AD is a common side

3)Included angles ZBAD=/CAD (By construction)

Therefore, AABD=AACD [Side-Angle-Side Theorem]

.. ZABD=/ACD

Hence, ZABC=/ACB (Proved)
