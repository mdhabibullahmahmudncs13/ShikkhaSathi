Solution: Repeating decimal fractions 5.6, 7.345, and 10.78423 have
nonrepeating digits equalling 0, 1 and 2 respectively. Here 10.78423 has the
most number of digits in nonrepeating part, so in order to convert into similar
repeating decimal fractions we must have 2 digits in nonrepeating part of every
number. 5.6, 7.345 and 10.78423 in repeating decimal fractions have respectively 1,
2 and 3 digits in the repeating part. LCM of 1, 2 and 3 is 6. So in order to
convert into similar repeating decimal fractions we must have 6 digits in the
repating part of every number. So, 5.6 = 5.66666666, 7.345 = 7.34545454 and
10.78423 = 10.78423423. Desired similar repeating decimal fractions are
respectively 5.66666666, 7.34545454 and 10.78423423.
