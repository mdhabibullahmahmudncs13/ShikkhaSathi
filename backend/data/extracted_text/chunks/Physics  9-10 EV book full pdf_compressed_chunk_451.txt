5.6.2 Fourth State of Substance
Despite solids, liquids and gases, the three different sates of matter, substances
may have a fourth state named plasma. We know the number of the positively
charged protons in the nucleus of a molecule or an atom is equal to the number
of negatively charged electrons outside it. That’s why the combined charge of a
molecule or atom is zero. Under special conditions a molecule or an atom can be
ionized, one or more electrons of some atoms can be made free, then separately
the atoms do not remain charge neutral. A kind of a mixture of ions and electrons
is made. Though it stays like a gas but all of the properties of gas are not true for
it. Like we know, a gas has no fixed shape but a fixed shape of plasma canbe ~~ &
made by a magnetic field. o
