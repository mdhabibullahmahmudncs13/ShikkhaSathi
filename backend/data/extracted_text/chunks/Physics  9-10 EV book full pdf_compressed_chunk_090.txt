Now we can discuss how accuracy can be measured. The measurement of
accuracy is the absolute error. Observing the name we understand that this is the
difference of the measured value with respect to the actual value. You can
definitely understand that when we measure anything we don’t know the actual
value. So, instead of absolute error we use the most probable error. Therefore in
our previous example the absolute error is

|£0.5 mm| = 0.5 mm
