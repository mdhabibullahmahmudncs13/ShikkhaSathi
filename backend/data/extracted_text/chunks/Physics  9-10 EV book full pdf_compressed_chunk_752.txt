F=k (6 1%
rT

the unit of k will be Nm?*/C?, so that the unit of F becomes N.

The value of &:
k =9 x 10° Nm2/C?

Coulomb is the unit of charge. We will see in the next chapter that the flow of
charge is electricity or current, and the unit of current is ampere. If one ampere
current flows for one second, the amount of charge that flows is called one
coulomb (C).
But, the authentic way to understand the coulomb is to understand the amount
of charge of an electron or proton. Its amount is:

Charge of electron : —1.6 x 107° C
