========================================

v = at
v  16.67m/s
J = 2
a=; 505 0.278 m/s
Question: A car is moving with a velocity of 60 mile/hour, suddenly its engine
stops. It takes 5 minutes to come at rest. What is the deceleration of the car?
Answer: When there is acceleration, velocity increases; where as velocity
decrease of when there is negative acceleration or deceleration.
Again we will use s for time and m for distance.
1 mile = 1.6 km = 1600 m
Initial velocity of car,
— 60 miles _ 60x 1.6 x 1000m _ /
YE hour TT 60x05 oom
Final velocity of car, v=0
