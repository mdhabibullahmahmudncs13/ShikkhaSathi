Question: Why does a glass crack when hot water is poured in it?
Answer: More expansion occurs at different parts of glass when temperature is
increased suddenly, this is why the glass cracks.
Question: The density of gold is 19.30 gm/cc and co-efficient of linear
expansion is 14x10° °C'.What will be the density when the temperature is
increased to 100 °C ?
Answer:
Density, _m

Here, V is volume and m is mass. Though the mass remains the same, the
volume increases when temperature is increased. So, if the temperature is
increased to 100° C, the volume will be :
V' = V+ yV(T, = Ty) = V(1 + 3a x 100)
a=14x10"°°C"
V' =V(1+42x1073)
