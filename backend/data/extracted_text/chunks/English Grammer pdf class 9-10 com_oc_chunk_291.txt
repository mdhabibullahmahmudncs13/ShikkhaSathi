with a question. These questions are different from the wh-questions or
‘yes/no’ questions. These are called tag questions.
We also notice that, if the statement is affirmative, the tag question is
negative. If the statement is negative, the tag question is affirmative.
So, a tag question is a kind of question asked by the speaker after a negative or
an affirmative statement during conversation. They are normally used in
speech when we want to:
= confirm that something is true or not, or
= to encourage a reply from the person we are speaking to.
