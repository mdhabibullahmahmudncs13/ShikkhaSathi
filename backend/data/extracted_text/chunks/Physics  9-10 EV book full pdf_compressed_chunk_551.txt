If the deviation or disturbance in a quantity changes position with time,
it is referred to as a wave. A single disturbance can constitute a wave,
while a series of repeated disturbances can also generate a wave; in this
context, it is called a wave train.Generally, the term 'wave' refers to peri-
odic wave trains, while single disturbances are less commonly referred
to by this term.

Some waves require a medium to propagate, while others do not. Waves that

need a gaseous, liquid, or solid medium to travel through are known as mechan-

ical waves. In these types of waves, the particles of the medium actively partici-

pate in the wave propagation.

When a stone is thrown into a pond, a single wave is created that spreads
