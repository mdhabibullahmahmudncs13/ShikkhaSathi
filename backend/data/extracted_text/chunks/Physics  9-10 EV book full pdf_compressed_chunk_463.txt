Chapter Six
Effects of Heat on Matter
a ee ll
ase

Heat is a kind of energy. From the concept of energy we may think that heat
flows always from higher heat energy to lower heat energy, but it is not true. In
which direction heat will flow, depends on the temperature. In this chapter we
will see how we can measure heat or temperature and what is the relation
between them.
Actually heat energy comes from the motion of molecules, atoms or their
vibrations. If the vibration of molecules of any solid object is increased to a great
extent, then molecules may go far from another one, that is, a change of state
may occur. In this chapter we will discuss the effect of heat on solids, liquids and “-
gases. s
