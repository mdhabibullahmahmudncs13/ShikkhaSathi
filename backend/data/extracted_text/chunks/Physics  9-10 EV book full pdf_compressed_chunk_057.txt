1.5.1 Units of Measurement
Among these units second, meter and candela are defined before by some
constants.
From May 2019 kilogram, kelvin, mole and ampere are also defined by some
constant of Physics. Now it is possible to measure all units very accurately using
these constant in any laboratory in the world.
Magnitude of fundamental constants those are essential to measure these seven
units are specified forever. The magnitude of seven constants are shown in the
