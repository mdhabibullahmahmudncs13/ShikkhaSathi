12.1: Magnet
All of you have seen a magnet. If a magnet is brought close to iron like materials,
then it attracts the iron. There is nothing visible between the magnet and iron but
an invisible force is pulling it. When observing that for the first time, one kind
of surprise is developed in all.
Those of you who have played the magnets must have noticed (Figure 12.01)
that there are two poles of a magnet. The similar poles repel, while the dissimilar
poles attract each other.

The poles are generally named the north and south poles.
If a bar magnet is suspended freely, it always points towards the north-south
direction.
