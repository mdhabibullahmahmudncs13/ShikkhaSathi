========================================

You have seen that wet clothes do not dry easily in the rainy season. On the other
hand in winter the clothes become dry naturally when they are kept inside the
house. After washing the clothes should be spread well for drying. If the wet
clothes are kept folded, they remain wet. The matter of drying of wet clothes is
nothing but the evaporation of water. So, you notice that the evaporation of
water depends on some factors. To speak the truth, what is true for water is also
true for other liquids. Therefore, we can make a list of the factors on which the
evaporation of liquids depends:

Flow of air: The rate of vaporization increases if the air flows faster over the
liquid.
