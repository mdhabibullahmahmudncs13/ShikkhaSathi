========================================

formulae and their related corollaries have been discussed elaborately. In this
chapter, those are reiterated and some of their applications are presented through
examples. Besides, extension of the formulae of square and cube, resolution into
factors using remainder theorem and formation of algebraic formulae and their
applications in solving practical problems have been discussed here in detail.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —
» expand the formulae of square and cube by applying algebraic formulae.
» explain the remainder theorem and resolve into factors by applying the
theorem.
» form algebraic formulae for solving real life problems and solve the problems
by applying the formulae.
