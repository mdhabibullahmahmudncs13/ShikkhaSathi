========================================

Solution: Let x litre of water flows in per minute by the first pipe and the tank
can contain y litre of water.
According to the question, the tank is filled up by first pipe in 12 minutes
sy=12z (1)
Again, the empty tank is filled up by the two pipes together in 96 minutes.
oy =962— 96x14 ++ (2)
From equation (1) we get, z = 2
putting the value of in equation (2) we get,
y
=96x — —96 x 14
Y 12
or, y =8y — 96 x 14
or, Ty = 96 x 14
96 x 14
or, y = ———=192

- Hence, total 192 litre of water is contained in the tank.
