Prove the theorem.
Theorem 18. All equal chords of a circle are equidistant from the centre.
Let AB and C'D be two equal chords of a circle with »
centre O. It is to be proved that the chords AB and EE
CD are equidistant from the centre O. C LN
Drawing: Draw from O the perpendiculars OF %
and OF to the chords AB and C'D respectively. Join AB
0, Aand O, C.
Proof:
Step 1. OE L AB and OF L CD
Therefore, AE = BE and CF = DF [ The perpendicular from the
centre bisects the chord]
SAE = JAB and CF = 30D
Step 2. But AB =CD [supposition] N
3
AE =CF S
