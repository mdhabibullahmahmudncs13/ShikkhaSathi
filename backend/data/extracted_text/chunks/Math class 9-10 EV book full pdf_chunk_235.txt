========================================

Equation: There are two polynomials on two sides of the equal sign of an
equation, or there may be zero on one side (mainly on right hand side). Degree
of the variable of the polynomials on two sides may not be equal. Solving an
equation, we get the number of values of the variable equal to the highest degree
of that variable. This value or these values are called the roots of the equation.
The equation will be satisfied by the root or roots. In the case of more than
one root, these may be equal or unequal. Such as, roots of 2? — 5z + 6 = 0 are
2,3. Again, though the value of z in equation (x — 3)* = 0 is 3, the roots of the
equations are 3,3.
Identity: There are two polynomials of same (equal) degree on two sides of equal
