3.1.2 Force
Actually Newton’s first law of motion can be the definition of force. Force is
that quantity the application of which a stationary object start move and a body
moving, with a uniform velocity change its velocity. From Newton's first law we
can understand, what is force but cannot measure it. But from the second law, we
will learn to measure force.
When you use force in your daily life for different purposes, you may realize that
for the application of some forces it is necessary to come in contact with the
object (e.g. to lift heavy objects with the help of a crane, to push anything or
coming to rest of moving objects due to friction). Whereas you may have noticed
that for the application of some other forces, it is not necessary to come into
