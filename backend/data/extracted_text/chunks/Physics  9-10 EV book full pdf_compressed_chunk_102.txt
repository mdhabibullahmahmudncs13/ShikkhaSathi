main scale.
(d) The frist measurement of length measured by Rashed was irrelevant to

physics class and told them to determine the volume of the box. The students
observed that the ruler could be used to measure upto cm only. They determined
the length, breadth, and height of the box as 20 cm, 15 cm and 10 cm
respectively.
(a) What is its dimension?
(b) Why weight and mass are not the same type of quantity?
(¢) Determine the percentage of relative error in the measurement of volume
of the box?
(d) This ruler is appropriate for measuring the area of the book but not
