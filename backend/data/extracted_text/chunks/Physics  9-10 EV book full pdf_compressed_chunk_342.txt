(b) Chemical energy

Chemical energy is certainly an important example of transformation of energy.
The gas which is used for cooking is an example of transformation of chemical
energy into heat energy. Due to this, when electrical energy is supplied to our
residence, simultaneously gas is also supplied. Due to the conversion of
chemical energy into heat energy, we also get light energy.
