Effect of Heat on Matter 179
some time to evaporate but the same amount of water poured into a plate
evaporate much faster.
Nature of liquid: The less the boiling point of a liquid, the higher would be the
rate of evaporation. The rate of evaporation of volatile liquids is a maximum.
Pressure of air: The lower the pressure of air, the more the rate of evaporation.
The rate of evaporation in vacuum is a maximum, so air is taken out to make dry
food with a pump for preservation of the food.
Temperature: If the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid increases,
the rate of evaporation will increase.
Dryness of air: The drier the air over the liquid surface is, the more the liquid
evaporates.
