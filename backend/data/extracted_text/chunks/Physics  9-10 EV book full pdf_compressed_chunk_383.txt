Therefore, area itself is considered as a vector! A vector must have a magnitude
and the direction. The amount of area is the  magnitade of vector, the
perpendicular on the area is the direction of the vector.
Since pressure is a scalar quantity, it has no direction. It is so necessary, because
the concept of pressure is more important for a liquid and gas than the solid.
When liquids and gases apply pressure then actually it does not depend on the
direction. We will see this matter very soon.
