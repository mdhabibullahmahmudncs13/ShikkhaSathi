========================================

V, = 13 +3al3(T, — Ty)...
But we know Vv, =13
That is , Vy = Vy + 3aVy(T, = Ty)
So, Vo =Vi +i (T, = Ty)
Certainly we can write
In our practical life we have to keep in mind the issue of expansion of solids. You
have seen the gap between the rails of rail tracks. This has been done taking
thermal expansion into consideration. If no space was left for expansion, the rail
lines would bend. Cavities develop in teeth due to lack of regular brushing. The
dentist fills these cavities with a special type of substance. The co-efficient of
expansion of the substance has been made very carefully which is equal to that
of the teeth. If the co-efficient of expansion were less than that of teeth, it would
come out from the cavity while eating something hot! Again, if the co-efficient
