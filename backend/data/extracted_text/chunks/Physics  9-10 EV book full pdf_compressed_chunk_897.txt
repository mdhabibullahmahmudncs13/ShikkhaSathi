========================================

If the two ends of a coil are connected

with an ammeter and a bar magnet is =H

inserted in it, then at the time of A

inserting the magnet we will see a Ld si

sudden flow of current in the ammeter ; 5

(Figure 12.11). When we will pull it wits

out, again we will see a sudden flow f QO Foy,

of current in the ammeter, but now in \S ‘4

the opposite direction. If we change >

the pole of the magnet, then we will

see the change of direction of current

in the ammeter also! During the time

of changing the magnetic field in a Figure 12.12: When a magnet enters
coil of wire, the generation of voltage into a solenoid current is produced in it.
and current in the coil is called elec-

tromagnetic induction. This voltage is called induced voltage, and the current is
called induced current.
