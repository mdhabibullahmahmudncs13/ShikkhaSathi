========================================

both the sums ore the same.
Example 11. Add 8.9478, 2.346 and 4.71.
Solution: In order to make repeating decimal fractions similar we must have 3
nonrepeating digits and repeating part must have digits equal to LCM of 2 and
3, that is 6. Now decimal fractions will be added.
8.9478 = 8.947847847
2346 = 2346000000
471 =4m7inng
16.011019564 [8+ 0+ 1+ 1 = 10, Here 1 is 1 in hand
+1 Here 1 of 10 has been added]
16.011019565
The desired sum is 16.011019565
