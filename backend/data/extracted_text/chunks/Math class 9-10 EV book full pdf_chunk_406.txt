pass through the centre. In this case, draw a line B

segment AD at A passing through the centre.

Proof:

Step 1. In AAOB the external angle ZBOD = /BAO + ZABO [An
exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite
angles]

Step 2. In AAOB, OA =0B [- Radius of same circle]

Therefore, ZBAO = ZABO [.- Base angles of an isosceles triangle are
equal]

Step 3. From steps (1) and (2), ZBOD = 2/BAO

Step 4. Similarly, from AAOC, ZCOD = 2/CAO

Step 5. From steps (3) and (4),

ZBOD + ZC0D = 2/BA0O +2/C AO [by adding]
This is the same as ZBOC = 2/BAC (Proved)
