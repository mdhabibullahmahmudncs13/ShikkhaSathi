========================================

Corollary 11. (x — a) will be a factor of f(z) if and only if f(a) = 0.
Proof: Let, f(a) = 0. Therefore, according to remainder theorem, if f(x) is
divided by (x — a), the remainder will be zero. Hence, (x — a) will be a factor of
f(x).
Conversely, let, (x — a) is a factor of f(z).
Therefore, f(x) = (x — a) - h(x), where h(x) is a polynomial. 5
Putting x = a in both sides we get, S
