Question: Let’s suppose the mass of the gold crown of Archimedes is 10 kg in
air and 9.4 kg when immersed in water. What is the density of the crown?
Answer: If the volume of the crown is Vand density is # then
Vp=10kg
Vp—Vp, =94kg
Vp, =Vp—94kg=10kg—9.4kg = 0.6 kg
0.6 kg 0.6 kg 33
v= on = 105i = 06% 10 m
10 kg 10 kg
=== kg/m?
P= Toe x10 Tm 16666 ke/m
Real density of gold is 19,300 kg/m?, therefore it is understood that the crown is
mixed by impurities.
5.3.4 Pascal’s Law
We have shown many times in this chapter that if pressure is applied on a liquid,
it is transmitted towards all directions. You will understand that it is normal if
you think a bit. Because if the pressure is not transmitted into the whole liquid
