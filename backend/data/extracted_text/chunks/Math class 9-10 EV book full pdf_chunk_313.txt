Chapter 6. Lines, Angles and Triangles 129
Vertical angle

Two angles are said to be the opposite angles if the

sides of one are the opposite rays of the other. h 5

In the adjoining figure OA and OB are mutually

opposite rays. So are the rays OC and OD. The

angles ZBOD and ZAOC are a pair of opposite 0

angles.

Similarly, ZBOC and ZDOA are another pair of c B
opposite angles. Therefore, two intersecting lines

produce two pairs of opposite angles.

Theorem 1. The sum of the two adjacent angles which a ray makes with a
straight line on its meeting point is equal to two right angles.

Proof:

Let, the ray OC meets the straight line AB at O. As

a result two adjacent angles ZAOC and ZCOB are D C
formed. Draw a perpendicular DO on AB.
