In this way the procedure may continue indefinitely. So v2 = 1.4142135.. .is an
infinite decimal fraction.
Value and approximate values up to certain decimal point
It is not the same to calculate an infinite decimal fraction up to decimal places
or approximate it to certain decimal places. For example, 5.4325893... when
calculated up to 4 decimal places will give 5.4325 whereas its approximate value
up to 4 decimal places will give us 5.4326. However, these two values are same
if we calculate up to 2 decimal places. We can do the same for finite decimal
fractions as well.
Remarks: For finding values up to certain decimal places we must write down
those digits exactly as they are. However, for finding approximation up to certain
