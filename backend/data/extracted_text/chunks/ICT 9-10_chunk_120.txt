========================================

playing computer games. A few of you did

not leave the computer even though you

should have for an important task. The users who have the internet access have
Facebook accounts too. When you post status on the Facebook, you eagerly wait
for a long time to see whether somebody gives a 'Like' to your status. You feel
pleasure when the number of your Facebook frends increases. Perhaps you may
have spent more time on Facebook than usual. You might have done better in the
examination if you had spent less time on this social network. You could have
read some good books or played a bit more outside in the playground or spent
mote time with your family members.
