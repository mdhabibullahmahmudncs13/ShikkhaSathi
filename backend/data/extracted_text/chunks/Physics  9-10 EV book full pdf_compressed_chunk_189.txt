========================================

that it is not true. If a body in uniform velocity stops then we have to realize that
force has been applied by some means. Friction, air resistance etc. actually stops
a moving body by applying force in the opposite direction. If all these forces
could be withdrawn, then we would find that a body in uniform motion keeps its
perpetual motion for ever.
3.1.1 Inertia
The characteristic that a stationary body wants to be stationary or a body in
motion wants to keep its motion, unless a force is applied, is called inertia. When
a car at rest suddenly starts moving we move backwards, this is an example of
inertia. The lower part of the body is attached to the car. When the car starts
moving, the lower part of the body moves with the car but the upper part of the
