========================================

fla)=(a—a) h(a) +r =0-h(a)+r=r
Hence, r = f(a)
Therefore, if f(z) is divided by (z — a), the remainder is f(a). This formula is
known as remainder theorem. That is, the remainder theorem gives the remainder
when a polynomial f(z) of positive degree is divided by (x —a) without performing
actual division. In the above example if a = 1, then f(x) = 62% — 7x + 5.
oo f(1) = 6—=T7+5 = 4 which is equal to the remainder. The degree of the divisor
polynomial (z—a) is 1, If the divisor is a factor of the dividend, the remainder will
be zero and if it is not zero, the remainder will be a number other than zero.
Corollary 11. (x — a) will be a factor of f(z) if and only if f(a) = 0.
Proof: Let, f(a) = 0. Therefore, according to remainder theorem, if f(x) is
