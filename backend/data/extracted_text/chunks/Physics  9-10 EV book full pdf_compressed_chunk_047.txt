========================================

force. After the invention of radioactivity while explaining a special radiation
called beta ray, a new type of force called weak nuclear force was discovered.
Later, the physicists showed that electrometric force and weak nuclear force are
the different forms of the same force. Their combination is called the electro
weak force. The physicists argue that two other forces in nature called
gravitational force and nuclear force will be brought under the same law in the
future.
Physics is unveiling the mystery of nature one after another. Similarly we can
say that an object consists of molecules, later on we see that the molecules
consist of atoms of elements. Despite the atoms being charge neutral, there is a
