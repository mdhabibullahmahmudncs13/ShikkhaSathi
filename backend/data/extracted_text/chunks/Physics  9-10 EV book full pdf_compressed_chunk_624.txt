========================================

they are reflected perpendicularly and go back along the line they were as
incident on.

(ii) If light rays travel parallel to the principal axis (Figure 8.19, XP), they will
appear to have diverged from the focal (F) point.

(iii) If the direction of the light ray is changed, it goes back the way it has
come. When the light ray is travelling towards the focus (Figure 8.19, QP),
it will be reflected parallel to principal axis (PX).

We can now create an image using these three rules. In figure 8.19, an object XY

is kept in front of a convex mirror. The light ray travelling from point Y towards

R will be reflected back along the same path towards Y, which means the image

of the point Y will be created somewhere along the line YO. To know exactly

where the image is formed, we Q
