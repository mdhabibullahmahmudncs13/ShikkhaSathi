Effect of Heat on Matter 177
On the solid being totally liquefied the temperature starts to increase again (as
shown in the figure 6.08). The temperature increases gradually and at one stage
the liquid starts to convert into gas. This process is called vaporization and the
temperature at which vaporization occurs is called the boiling point. Again,
everyone is being reminded that this boiling point depends upon pressure.
When the process of vaporization starts by absorbing the heat energy, the
molecules of the liquid start to become free from the molecular bonds among
themselves. Here also the temperature does not increase like fusion even if heat
is applied. During vaporization of liquid the amount of heat by which the whole
