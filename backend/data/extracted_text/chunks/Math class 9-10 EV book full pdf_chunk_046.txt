========================================

Note: In order to clarify addition at the rightmost digit we have solved the
addition in a different way:
3.89 = 3.89898989[89
2.178 = 2.17878787|87
5.80798 = 5.80798798|79
11.97576576(55
Here after the end of repe ating part some more digits have been taken. These extra
digits have been separated by a vertical line. Then the addition has been performed.
From the addition of digits just after the vertical line 2 in hands has been added
to the digits just before the vertical line. It may be noted here the digit on the
right side of the vertical line is the same as the first digit of repeatation. Therefore
both the sums ore the same.
Example 11. Add 8.9478, 2.346 and 4.71.
Solution: In order to make repeating decimal fractions similar we must have 3
