========================================

Power Sets
A = {m,n} is a set. Subsets of A are {m,n}, {m},{n}, @, and set of all
sets {{m.n},{m},{n}, @} of Ais called power set of A. Power set of A is
denoted by P(A). So the set formed by all subsets of a set is called power set of
a given set.
Example 10. Find the number of elements of the power sets A = @, B = {a},
C = {a,b}.
Solution: Here P(A) = {&}
.. number of elements of A is 0 and number of elements of its power set is =1 =
20
Again P(B) = {{a}, 2}
number of elements of B is 1, and number of eleemnts of its power set is
=2=2"
and P(C) = {{a}, {0}, {a,b}, @}
~~. number of elements of C' is 2 and number of elements of its power set is = 4 =
92
So, if number of elements of a set is n, then number of elements of its power set is

5 2
