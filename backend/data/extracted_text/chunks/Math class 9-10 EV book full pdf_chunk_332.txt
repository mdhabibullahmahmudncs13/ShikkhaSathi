========================================

In ADBC exterior angle ZADC > ZABC [. [Exterior angle is greater

than each of the interior opposite angles]

LACD > £LABC. Therefore, ZACB > ZABC, but this is against the

given condition.
Step 2. Similarly, (ii) if AB < AC, it can be proved that

ZABC > ZACB, but this is also against the condition.
Step 3. So neither AB > AC nor AB < AC.

AB = AC (Proved)

Let, in AABC and ADEF, AB = DE, AC = DF
and BC = EF. Therefore, AABC = ADEF
