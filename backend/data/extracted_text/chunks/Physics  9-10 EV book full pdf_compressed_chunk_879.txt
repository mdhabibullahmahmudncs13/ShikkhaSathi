Magnetic Effects of Current 333
‘When a charge is kept in a place, an electric field is produced around it. Similarly,
if electric current flows through a wire, a magnetic field will be is created around
it.
Let us assume that a wire penetrates through the middle of a cardboard
and some small compasses are placed on the cardboard around the wire. The
compasses will be aligned along north-south direction. Now if a current
(moderately strong) passes through the wire, you will surprisingly notice that
suddenly the compasses are arranging themselves one after another. You will get
an impression that a circular magnetic field around the wire has been generated
due to the electric current.
