========================================

(Figure 9.02). Remember that refractive index of a medium has no direct relation
with density of that medium.

Figure 9.02 : The refracted ray bends towards the normal when entering
from a rarer medium to a denser medium, and it goes away from the
normal when entering from a denser medium to a rarer medium.
Here only the incident ray and refracted rays are drawn, as refraction of light is
discussed, but we must remember that when a ray of light goes from one
medium to another every time some amount of light is reflected. How much light
will be reflected and how much light will refracted depends on the angle of
incidence. When there is an increase in the angle of incidence, the reflection
