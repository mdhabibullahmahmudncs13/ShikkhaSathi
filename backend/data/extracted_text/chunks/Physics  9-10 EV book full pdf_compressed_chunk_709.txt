9.4.2 Convex Lens
The images in convex lens are amazing. The image which we got from a
concave mirror, is the same as the images in a convex lens. We have seen in the
case of a convex mirror that if a parallel ray falls on it, then it converges at the
focal point. The same thing happens in the case of a convex lens, if parallel rays
fall on it, they will meet at the focal point (Figure 9.21) and again spread out.
Therefore, using previous logic we can say that if light diverges from a point and
the source of the divergent light (Figure 9.22) is placed in the focal point of a
lens, then while passing through the lens, rays of light will emerge as parallel a
