table is made. In the context of the above discussion, the cumulative frequency
distribution of temperature in Example 1 is as follows:
Temperature (in celcius) Cumulative Frequency
NESE
12° — 14° (24+7)=31
Example 2. The marks obtained in English by 40 students in an annual
examination are given below. Make a cumulative frequency table of the marks
obtained.
70, 40, 35, 60, 55, 58, 45, 60, 65, 80, 70, 46, 50, 60, 65, 70, 58, 60, 48, 70, 36, 85,
60, 50, 46, 65, 55, 61, 72, 85, 90, 68, 65, 50, 40, 56, 60, 65, 46, 76
Solution:
Range of the data = (highest numerical value — lowest numerical value) + 1 =
(90 —35)+1=55+1=56
56
Let the class interval be 5 then the number of classes = + = 11.2 or 12 [taking
