A triangle has three sides and three angles. Triangles are classified by sides into
three types: equilateral, isosceles and scalene.
By angles triangles are also classified into three types: acute angled, right angled
and obtuse angled.
The sum of the lengths of three sides of the triangle is the perimeter. By triangle
we also denote the region closed by the sides. The line segment drawn from a
vertex to the mid-point of opposite side is known as the median. Again, the
