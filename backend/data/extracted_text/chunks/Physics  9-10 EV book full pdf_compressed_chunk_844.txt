If the resistances are more than two (Fig. 11.14) then the equivatent resistance
R will be

11 + 1 + 1 a 1

11.3 Electric Power
When discussing potential, we saw that if a charge is moved by applying
a potential then some work is done or some energy is lost. So if V potential is
applied to move a charge Q in a circuit then the amount of work done (or the
applied energy) is W =VvQ Joule
Power P is the capacity of work done per second, so if Q charge is moved in ¢
time then w vo

If we use this on a single resistance R, then applying Ohm’s law we can write,
since Vr
