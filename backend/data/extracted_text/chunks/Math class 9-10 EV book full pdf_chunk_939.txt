Now, we get from (4) and (5)

(2) Method of Elimination

Applying by this method, we can solve the equations by following the steps

below :

(a) Multiply both the equations by two such numbers separately so that
the coefficients of one variable become equal.

(b) If the coefficients of a variable are of the same or opposite sign, subtract
or add the equations. The equation after subtraction (or addition) will
be reduced to an equation of one variable.

(c) Find the value of a variable by the method of solution of simple equation.
