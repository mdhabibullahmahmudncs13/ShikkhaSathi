6.1 Heat and Temperature:
Heat is a kind of energy. We have seen that energy can do work. By applying
force it is possible to displace a body in the direction of the force, for example
heat is produced by burning fuel oil in a train or a car and this produced energy
creates motion in the train or car. So this new form of energy is called heat
energy like light, electricity or kinetic energy.
It is interesting that if we could see on the molecular level i.e., looking at any
substance if we see its molecules, we should call it "kinetic energy" instead of
the "heat energy". Because what we mean by heat energy is actually nothing but
the combined kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance. When the
