========================================

The points 4, B, C and D are the vertices of the quadrilateral. Z4BC, ZBCD,
ZCDA and ZDAB are the four angles of the quadrilateral. The vertices 4 and B are
the opposite vertices of C and D respectively. The pairs of sides AB and CD, AD
and BC are sides opposite to each other. The two sides that meet at a vertex are the
adjacent sides. For example, the sides, AB and BC are the adjacent sides. The line
segments AC and BD are the diagonals of ABCD. The sum of the lengths of sides is
the perimeter of the quadrilateral. The perimeter of the quadrilateral 4BCD is equal
to the length of (4B+BC+CD+DA). We often denote quadrilaterals by the
symbol ‘7°. ~
