The required area is 674.07 square metre (approx.)
Example 27. In the figure, ABCD is a rectangle whose length is 12 metre the
breadth is 10 metre. and DAF is a circular segment. Determine the length of the arc
DE and the area of the whole region.
Solution: The radius of the circular segment, r = AD = 12 metre and the angle
subtended at centre 6 = 30°.

The length of the rectangle ABCD is 12 metre and breadth is 10 metre.
.. Area of the rectangle = length x breadth = 12 x 10 = 120 square metre
.. Area of the whole region = (37.7 + 120) square metre = 157.7 square metre
