‘We cannot see it if the wavelength is larger or smaller than this range. If the wavelength
is from 400 nm to 700 nm, we can see the electromagnetic wave, and we call that light.
The colors we see in our eyes are actually lights of different wavelengths. When the
wavelength is less, it becomes violet. When the wavelength increases, the light
gradually becomes blue, green, yellow, orange, and red, and at one point it disappears!
Human eyes cannot see beyond this range- but various insects or other living beings
can see outside this range. The sensitivity of human eyes to different colors of light is
shown in Figure 8.1.
