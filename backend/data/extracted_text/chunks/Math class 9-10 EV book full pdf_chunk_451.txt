related problems and in navigation etc. Now a days trigonometry is in wide use
in Astronomy and Calculus.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —
» describe the trigonometric ratios of acute angles.
» determine the mutual relations among the trigonometric ratios of acute
angle.
» solve and prove the mathematical problems justifying the trigonometric
ratios of acute angle.
» determine and apply trigonometric ratios of acute angles 30°, 45°, 60°
geometrically. i.
» determine and apply the value of meaningful trigonometric ratios of the g
