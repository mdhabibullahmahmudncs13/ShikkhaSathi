Determining the Nature of Charge
If charge is accumulated in an object, we
can determine whether it is positive or
negative using an electroscope. At first,
we have to give some known charge to the
disc of the electroscope. If we create
a positive charge in the glass rod by &

rubbing it with silk and then touch it to the disc, the reduction of gap between the

leaves will indicate the electroscope has negative charge. If the gap increases,

then it will indicate the presence of positive charge.

Induction of Charge

‘We can determine if an object contains charge without touching the disc. Let us

imagine, a positively charged rod is brought near the disc. Then the disc will
