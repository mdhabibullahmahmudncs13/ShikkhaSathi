========================================

equal or (z,y) = (a,b) if and only if x = a and y = b.

Example 11. If (22 + y,3) = (6,2 — y) then, determine (x.y).

Solution: Given,(2r + y,3) = (6,7 —y)

As per conditions of ordered pairs,

ry =06---(1)

T—y=3-(2)

By adding equations (1) and (2) we get 3z =9 or z = 3

Putting value of z in equation (1) we get, 6 +y =6 or y =0

cory) = (3,0)

Mr Karim decided to colour interior wall of his rooms using white or blue colour,

and outside wall using red, yellow or green. The set of colours of interior wall

is A = {white, blue} and that of outside wall is B = {red, yellow and green }

Mr Karim can colour walls of his rooms by (white, red), (while, yellow), (white,

green), (blue, red), (blue, yellow), (blue, green) ordered pairs. The above ordered
