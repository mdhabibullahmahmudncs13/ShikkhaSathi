Reflection of Light 213
8.1. Nature of Light
What we see with our eyes is light. We see trees, the sky, chairs and tables,
human beings, but that doesn't mean that these are light. Light reflects from
these objects and comes into our eyes, and the retina of our eyes creates and
sends signals to our brain. Then our brain can recognize whether it is a tree or a
human being. The whole process starts with light entering into our eyes.
