Chapter 3. Algebraic Expressions 73

If selling price is Tk. 1, cost price is Tk. ———.
100 =r
Again, if cost price is Tk. 100, selling price at the profit of s% is Tk. (100 + s).
100 100 +
.. if cost price is Tk. 00—7 selling price at the profit of s% is Tk. (“ x
100
100 —r
100 +s
= Tor
100 +s
Therefore, in Tk. To number of oranges is to be sold is n.
. . 100 —r
In tk. 1 number of oranges is to be sold is n x =
100 —
Hence, R=) oranges are to be sold per taka.
Example 40. What is the profit of Tk. 650 in 6 years at the rate of profit Tk.
7 percent per annum ?
Solution: We know, I = Pnr
Here, P =Tk.650 n = 6 year, percent per annum s = Tk.7
a s 7

1 =6 — =273
he 50 x 6 x 100
Hence, profit is Tk. 273.
