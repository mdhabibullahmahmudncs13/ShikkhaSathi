2 Physics
If we read the history of physics we will see that it is developed by the combined
efforts of both theoretical and experimental scientists. In order to carry out
research in the laboratory, we need to measure different quantities precisely.
This chapter offers discussion of how the measuring units are developed, how
one can measure and what type of instrument are used for measuring them.
® By the end of this chapter we will be able to-

o explain the scope and gradual development of physics.

o describe the objectives of studying physics.

o cxplain the physical quantities [with units and magnitude] and the origin of

physics.

e explain the necessity of measurement and units.

o explain the difference between fundamental and derived quantities.
