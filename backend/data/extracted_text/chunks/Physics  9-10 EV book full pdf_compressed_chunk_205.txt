3.3 Balanced and Unbalanced Forces

Force is a vector quantity; therefore, if a force is applied on an object then it is
possible to cancel that force by the application of another force from opposite
direction. Then we say that the forces are balanced. When two or more forces are
applied on an object and if the combined resultant force of the forces becomes
zero then the body has no acceleration.

In figure 3.02 it is shown that an object is suspended with a thread. The force of
attraction (i.e. weight of the object) of the earth on the object is acting vertically
downwards. Again another force i.e. the tension of the thread is acting vertically
upwards. Here two forces are acting in opposite direction thus canceling each
other’s action and producing a balanced condition.
