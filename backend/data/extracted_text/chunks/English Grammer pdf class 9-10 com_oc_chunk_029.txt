========================================

(i) When the noun is singular, its possessive form will be noun +s:
For example:
Della’s hair is very long.
This is Nazma’s bag.
However, in some possessives the letter s is omitted in order to avoid a hissing
sound.
For example:
Gi I have done it for conscience” sake.
=
8 You should sacrifice it for goodness’ sake.
