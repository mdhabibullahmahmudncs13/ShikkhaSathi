Chapter 5. Equations in One Variable 101
The rules stated above may be expressed in terms of algebraic expressions as
follows:
If zr =aand c #0,
(i)z+c=a+c (i) zr —c=a—c (iii) xc = ac (in) 2 =2
Besides, if a,b and ¢ are three quantities, if a =b+4¢, a —b=cand ifa+c=0b,
a=b—c
This law is known as transposition law and different equations can be solved by
applying this law. If the terms of an equation are in fractional form and if the
degree of the variables in each numerator is 1 and the denominator in each term
is constant, such equations are linear equations.
