9.4.1 Concave lens
While discussing about convex and Nal ’
concave mirrors, we first learned | a
about convex mirrors. In the case of =
lens at first we will discuss concave iy ge
lens. Because a concave lens forms the ~o- []
image a like a convex mirror. | SES
In the case of a convex mirror we saw Tal
that parallel rays diverts in all il facal =
directions during reflection. In the length
case of concave lens the same thing
occurs. The incident parallel Tays On pioure 9.18: Rays of light diverges

If we extend the refracted rays of light
backwards, it would seem that they
are spreading out directly from a point. o
