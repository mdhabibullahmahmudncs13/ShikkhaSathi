104 Physics
Therefore we can say firmly that the energy that develops due to motion in a
body is certainly one kind of energy or kinetic energy. In the previous chapter we
said that the terrible road accidents that happen and the losses that occur are
mainly due to kinetic energy. When a bus-truck or a car moves at high speed then
it has a huge amount of kinetic energy.
We can easily calculate how much kinetic energy is produced by an object when
work is done by a force on that object.
Let an object of mass m be displaced by an amount s due to the application of
force F. Therefore work done WW by the force F is:
W =Fs
According to Newton’s second law we know,
F=ma
Again, from the equations of motion we know that if an object starts its motion
from rest,
