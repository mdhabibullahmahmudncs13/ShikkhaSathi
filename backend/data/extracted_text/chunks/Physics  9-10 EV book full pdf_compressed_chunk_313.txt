108 Physics
energy is stored in a stone when the stone is raised above can also be calculated.
You are realizing that the amount of work to be done when an object is raised
above is stored in that object as potential energy. If the work done is 7,

W=Fh
Here, F is the applied force and / is the height. We have to apply the force F in
the upward direction and distance traversed is also in the upward direction,
therefore F is positive. The force that has to be applied for raising the object
upwards does not change as the spring force and this force is equal to the weight
of the stone. If the weight of the stone is mg,
