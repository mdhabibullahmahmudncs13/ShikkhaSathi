========================================

I 14
“R
So, current I comes out from point A of the battery and enters into point B. We
have determined the voltage and current at every point of the circuit.
Let us assume in the same circuit, if we connect AB part with the earth rather
than part DC (Figure 11.08(b)) what will happen then? As the voltage of the
battery cell is V volt, so the potential difference between A and D must be V, as
the voltage of A is zero, so the voltage of D must be -V. Therefore, the potential
difference between B and C has to be,
0-1) =v
Resistance is R, so electric current:

This is the same as the previous value, which is what it is supposed to be. See,
the magnitude of the potential has changed but the difference is the same.
