Example 15. In an examination of class IX of a school, total marks of «
students obtained in mathematics is 1950. If at the same examination, marks of
a new student in mathematics is 34 and it is added to the former total marks, the
average of the marks become less by 1.
1) Write down the average of the obtained marks of all students including the
new student and separately x students in terms of x.
2) By forming equation from the given conditions, show that, x? +357 —1950 = 0
3) By finding the value of x, find the average of the marks in the two cases
Solution:
. 1950
1) Average of the marks obtained by x students = ——
