Example 18. The diameter of a circle is 26 cm. Find its circumference.
Solution: Let, the radius of the circle is 7.
.. diameter of the circle = 2r and circumference = 27
. 26
As per question, 2r = 26 or, r = > or, =13 cm
circumference of the circle = 2m = 2 x 3.1416 x 13 cm = 81.68
cm (approx.)
2. Length of arc of a circle
Let O be the centre of a circle whose radius is r and
arc AB = s, which produces 6° angle at the centre. B
.. circumference of the circle = 27r 6
Total angle produced at the centre of the circle = 360° A A
and arc s produces angle 0° at the centre. We know,
any interior angle at the centre of a circle produced
by any arc is proportional to the arc.
