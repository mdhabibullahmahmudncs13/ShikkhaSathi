2. Area of Square Region: Let the length of each
side of a square ABCD be a and diagonal d. The
diagonal AC divides the square region into two equal A— C
triangular regions. BR
. Area of the square region ABCD = 2x area of GEE a
AABC =x a-a= a? = (length of a side)’ ca
Observe that, the perimeter of the square region s = 4 = vs == B
4a and diagonal d = va? + a2 = V2a2 = 2a

3. Area of a parallelogram region:
a) Base and height are given: Let, the base
AB = band height DE = h of parallelogram ABCD. D c
The diagonal BD divides the parallelogram into two
equal triangular regions.
.. The area of the parallelogram ABCD
