========================================

cars are damaged and the passengers are injured. Therefore to minimize the loss
in an accident, the easiest way is to keep the speed low. In our country, most of
the accidents occur due to the speeding of cars. Then it becomes difficult to
control the cars and a huge amount of energy is used up when the accident
occurs.
Let us consider that a head-on collision occurred between a heavy truck (m,)
loaded with stone and a small car (m,) coming with the same velocity. Which
one will be damaged more?
Since a head-on collision occurred, so velocity of the small car is opposite to that
of the truck.
Therefore, if u is the velocity of the truck then the velocity of the car is —u. Since,
the mass of the small car mm, is far less than the mass m, of the truck, so if m, is
