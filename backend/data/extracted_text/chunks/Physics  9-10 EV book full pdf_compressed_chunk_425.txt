========================================

then the friction will be

decreased further. The Figure 5.09: Air pressure reduces with height.
reason is that the planes

need powerful engines to fly and oxygen is required to burn the fuel of those
engines. The amount of oxygen is less where the density of air is less as at great
heights. So at higher altitudes the engine of the plane will not work due to the
shortage of oxygen.

Those who climb to the peak of mountains face the same problem. The higher
they climb the problem of less oxygen due to reducing density of air is more than
the problem of less air pressure. For this reason those who climb mountains have
to practice not only how to survive in less oxygen but also have to learn how to
