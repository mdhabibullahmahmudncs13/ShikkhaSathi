Effect of Heat on Matter 171
Certainly we can write:
Similarly we can assume a cube of L length, width and height. Its volume at
temperature 7, is | and the volume becomes 7, after increasing the temperature
to T,, so we have

Vy = [Ly + aly (T, = TD?
According to the same argument, also here if we avoid the parts with o* and o,
then no problem will arise in our analysis or calculation. So only the first two
terms will be present, i.e.
