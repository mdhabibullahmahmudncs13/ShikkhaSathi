Proper Subset

Of the subsets constructed from a set, the ones that have lesser number of elements
than the original set is called proper set. For example, A = {3,4,5,6} and
B = {3,5} are two sets. Here all elements of B are also clements of A, and
number of elements in Bis less than that of A.

.. Bis a proper subset of A and is expressed as B C A.

In the examples of subsets Q and R are each proper subset of P. It may be
mentioned here that @ is a proper subset of any set.

Example 5. Write down the subsets of P = {x,y,z} and identify those that
are proper subsets.

Solution: Given, P = {x,y,z}

Subsets of P are {z,y, =}, {ey}, (x. 2}. {v. 2}. {ae} {}. {=}. 2.

Proper subsets of P are {x,y}, {z, 2}, {y. 2}, {=}, {y}, {=}, ©
