========================================

The distance — time graph of the first data set of the table is shown in figure
a 2.09. We have taken data in integer form. From the graph we will be able to

find the distance of any time from 0 to 5s. For example the distance of the
object in 2.5 second is approximately 6.25m. If we have a velocity versus
time graph, from there we can find the velocity easily. Velocity of an object
is the rate of change of its position. So we can see from the graph the object
has travelled a distance of 0 m to 1 min 0 to 1 second. Therefore the average
velocity at this time,

1-0
,od-0m_ m/s
1s
We can use this average velocity for the mid-time value of 0 to Is. Similarly
the average velocity within 1 to 2s is,
(4-1)m
