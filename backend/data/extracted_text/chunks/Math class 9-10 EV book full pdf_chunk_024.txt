Chapter 1. Real Numbers 7
The decimal fraction for which the same digit or a set of digits in order appear
after decimal point is called repeating decimal fraction. The part of the
repeating decimal fraction that appears over and over again is called repeating.
The remaining part is nonrepating.
In a repeating decimal fraction if a single digit repeats, then a point is marked
above that digit. Otherwise point is marked on the first and the last repeating
digits. For example, 2.555... is written as 2.5 and 3.124124124 . .. as 3.124.
In a decimal number if every digit after decimal point is repeating, then it is called
a pure repeating fraction. Otherwise the fraction is called mixed. For example,
1.3 is a pure repeating fraction and 4.235112 is a mixed repeating fraction.
