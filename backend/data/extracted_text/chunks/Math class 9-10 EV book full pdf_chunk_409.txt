========================================

Proof:
Step 1. The angle standing on the arc ADB
1
ZACB = 3 (straight angle in the centre ZAOB) ['.- The angle standing
on an arc at any point of the circle is half the angle at the centre]
Step 2. But the straight angle ZAOB is equal to 2 right angles.
1
SL ZACB = 5 (2 right angles) = 1 right angle (Proved).
Corollary 4. The circle drawn with hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle as
diameter passes through the vertices of the triangle.
Corollary 5. The angle inscribed in the major arc of a circle is an acute angle.
