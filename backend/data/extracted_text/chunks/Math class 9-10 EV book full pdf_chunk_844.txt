========================================

3. To determine steps deviation, the difference between class mid-values and
approximate mean are divided by the class interval i.e.
Co mid value — approximate mean
steps deviation 4 = ——mM— —
class interval
4. To multiply the steps deviation by the corresponding class frequency.
5. To determine the mean of the deviation and to add this mean with 5
approximate mean to find the required mean. S
