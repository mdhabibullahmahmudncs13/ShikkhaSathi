Chapter 4. Exponents and Logarithms 93
Characteristics of Common Log
Let a number N be expressed in the scientific form as
N =a x10", where N > 0,1 <a<10and ne Z
Taking base 10 log of both sides we get.
log, N = log,o(a x 10") = log,a + log;,10™ = log, ya + nlog,,10
ology oN =n + logyga [1.7 logy10 = 1]
Suppressing the base 10, we have, logN = n + loga
n is called the characteristic of log/V.
Note: It is evident from the table that characteristic of a number having m
digits to the left of decimal point is 1 less than the number of digits to the left of
decimal sign and that will be positive. That is if the mentioned number of digits
is m, the characteristic of logarithm will be m-1.
