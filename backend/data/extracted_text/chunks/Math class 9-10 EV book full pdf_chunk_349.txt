22. Prove that, sum of the three medians of a triangle is less than the perimeter
of the triangle.

23. An industrious father called upon his only son and said that he hid gold in a
nearby forest which he bought with his earned money. When the son asked
about the position of the gold, he informed him that there were two similar
trees A and B and a stone S. After reaching from S to A, he would have
to go perpendicularly the same distance to find the point C'. Again coming
from S to B, he would have to travel the same distance perpendicularly to
find the point D. Then he would find the gold at the midpoint of the line
CD. The son found the trees A and B but unfortunately did not find S.
Will the son able to find the gold? If so, then how?
