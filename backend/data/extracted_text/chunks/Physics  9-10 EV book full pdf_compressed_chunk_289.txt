In this chapter we will see how force works. In terms of physics the word "work"
has a specific meaning. We will see that a force working on something can move
it and create kinetic energy. This kinetic energy can convert into potential energy
and this transformation of energy is a very natural process and different types of
energy can convert into one another.

One of the important aspect of science is energy and energy plays a most
important role for the development of mankind. So, how energy can be explored
from nature will also be discussed.
