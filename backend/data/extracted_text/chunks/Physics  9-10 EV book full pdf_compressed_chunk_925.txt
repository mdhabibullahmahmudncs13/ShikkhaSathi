========================================

The main three radioactive rays that emit from the nucleus are alpha, beta and
gamma rays (Figure 13.01).
13.1.1 Alpha ray
Alpha ray or alpha particle is actually a helium nucleus. A helium nucleus
contains two protons and two neutrons, so it is a charged particle. So its path of
motion can be influenced by electric and magnetic field. When an alpha particle
emits from a nucleus, it possesses some MeV of energy, so when it passes
through air and collides with the molecule -atoms it can ionize them intensively.
In air, the path of motion of an alpha particle is straight. Since an alpha particle
is a helium nucleus, it cannot travel far through air. It loses its energy by
ionizing air molecule-atoms ans travels approximately 6 cm through air before
