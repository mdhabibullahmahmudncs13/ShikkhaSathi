========================================

Observe that, through a point not on a line, a unique line parallel to it can be
drawn.
Euclid’s 5th Postulate (presented by graph)
When a transversal cuts two parallel straight lines,
1) the pair of corresponding angles are equal.
2) the pair of alternate angles are equal.
3) that pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal are
supplementary.
In the figure, AB || CD and the traversal PQ
P
intersects them at E and F respectively. E
A B
Therefore, r
[o) D
1) ZPEB = corresponding ZEFD [by definition] 4
2) ZAEF = alternate ZEFD
3) ZBEF + ZEFD = 2 right angles
‘Work:
Using alternate definitions of parallel lines prove the theorems related to
parallel straight lines.
