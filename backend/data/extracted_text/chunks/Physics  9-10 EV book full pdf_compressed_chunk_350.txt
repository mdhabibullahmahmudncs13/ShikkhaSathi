========================================

never imagine the mass as energy directly. But Einstein showed using his laws

of relativity, £ = mc? and with the help of this equation he informed us about the

possibility of transformation of mass into energy. In the nuclear bomb, the mass

was transformed into energy, where a huge amount of heat, light, and sound

energy destroyed the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This process of energy
S transformation can be used not only in nuclear bombs but also in nuclear power
