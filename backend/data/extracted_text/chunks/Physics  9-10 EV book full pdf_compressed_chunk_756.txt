Question: There is a proton in the center of a hydrogen atom and an electron
outside it. The charges of the proton and electron are +1.6x10"? Cand -1.6x10"”
C respectively. If the distance of the orbit of the electron from the nucleus is
0.510 m, how much attraction is found between them?
Answer:
Fk hte
Tr
Here, ¢1=+1.6x107C
q,=-1.6x10"1°C
k =9x 10° Nm2/C?
r=05x10"%m
9 —-19 -19
therefore, fr _ 9Xx10°%x 1.6 Xx 10719 x (—1.6 x 10719) N= —022x10-12 N
(0.5 x 10-8)2 :
The negative sign denotes there is attractive force between the proton and the electron
Question: How much charge should be stored in the earth and the moon so that
the gravitational force becomes zero and the moon goes out of its orbit?
