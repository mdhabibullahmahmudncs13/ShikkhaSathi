146 English Grammar and Composition
1. Intonation and meaning:
When a tag question is spoken, the voice can go up or down.
It is a nice party, fo it?
A falling intonation means the speaker is sure (or almost sure) that the
statement is true. He/she only wants to confirm. The tag is not really a
guestion.
A rising intonation means that even though the speaker expects to hear ‘yes’,
the speaker is less sure and wants to know.
You didn’t go there on business, did you?
B Why do we use tag questions?
We can use tag questions to verify or check information that we think is true,
or to check information that we aren't sure about.
The interesting things about tag questions are that they have varied uses. The
tag question is in fact a typical feature of conversation in English.
