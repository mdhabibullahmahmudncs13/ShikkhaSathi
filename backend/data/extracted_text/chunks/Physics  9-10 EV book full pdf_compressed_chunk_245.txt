========================================

we get:
T1-5g=5a
For the 5 kg mass, T_1 acts upward. Using Newton's second law horizontally for
the mass m, we obtain:
“T2+T1=m(-a)
Here, the force T_2 acts to the left, the force T_1 acts to the right, and the
acceleration of the mass mis directed to the left.
The mass mexperiences a downward gravitational forcemg and an upward
normal force N in the vertical direction, Because the resultant of the two forces
is zero, the mass m does not accelerate in the vertical direction. Now, applying
Newton's laws of motion vertically to the 10 kg mass, we find:
T2-10g=10(-a).
For the 10 kg mass, T_2 acts upward.
By solving the three equations above, we find that the combined acceleration of
the objects is given bya=5g/(10+5+m) and the total force acting on the mass is
