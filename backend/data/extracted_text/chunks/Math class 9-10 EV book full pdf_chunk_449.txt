Trigonometric Ratio
In our day to day life we make use of triangles, and in particular, right-angled
triangles. Many different examples from our surroundings can be drawn where
right triangles can be imagined to be formed. In ancient times, with the help
of geometry men learnt the technique of determining the width of a river by
standing on its bank. Without climbing the tree they knew how to measure the
height of the tree accurately by comparing its shadow with that of a stick. In all
the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using some
mathematical technique which come under a special branch of mathematics called
Trigonometry. The word “Trigonometry” is derived from Greek words ‘tri’ (means
