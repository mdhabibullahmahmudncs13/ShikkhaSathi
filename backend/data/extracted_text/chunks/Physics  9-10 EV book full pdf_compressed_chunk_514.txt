========================================

converted into liquids and liquids into gases, that one is ice converted into water
and water into vapour. Although we do not see directly the latent heat of fusion
or latent heat of vaporization, but we have felt its effect. When we suddenly
come to an open place or in open air from a crowded or a closed place, then our
sweating body becomes cool. This is because during the vaporization of
sweat, the required latent heat of vaporization is absorbed from our body and our
body becomes cool. By applying heat solids can be converted into liquids and
liquids into gases, its reverse process also occurs. By extracting heat gas can be
