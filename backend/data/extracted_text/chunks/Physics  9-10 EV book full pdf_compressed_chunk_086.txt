Error is a negative word and if the word "error in measurement" used, we think
that the person who is doing the measurement is not performing his duties
properly and an error has occurred! But this is not the case. Sometimes error
may occur due to the person who is doing the measurement for his negligence,
but we have to know that the instrument with which we measure is not error free.
Therefore, there is a limit of how much accurately we can measure, i.e. it is very
natural to have errors in measurement. But there is a need to mearuse to what
extent a measusement is accurate . The reliability of a result will be increased if
