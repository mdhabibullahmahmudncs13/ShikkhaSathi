Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 35
Example 15. Let us assume that A = {3,5} and B = {2,4}
SAX B= (35) x {2.4} = {(3,2),(3,4), (5,2). (5.4)}
SRC {(3,2),(3,4). (5,2), (5,4)}
when for an element x of set A and an element y of set B (x,y) € R, then it is
written Ry and read that x is related to y, that is, x is related to y using relation R.
If © > y, then R = {(3,2), (5.2), (5,4)}
and if z < y then R = {(3,4)}
Again, if there is a relation from set A to set A, that is, R C A x A, then Ris a
relation of A.
If x € A,y € Bis related, then the nonempty subset of ordered pairs (x,y) is called
relation.
Example 16. If P = {2,34}, Q = {4,6} and for elements of P and Q a
relation y = 2x exists, then find the relations.
Solution: Given, P = {2,3,4} and Q = {4,6}
