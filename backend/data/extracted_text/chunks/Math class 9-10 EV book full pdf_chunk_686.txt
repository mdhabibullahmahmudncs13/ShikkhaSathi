========================================

respectively, it can be shown that,

BA BC

ED = GF [theorem 28]

io AB BC AB AC BC

"DE EF "DE DF EF
The proposition opposite of theorem 32 is also true.
Theorem 33. If the sides of two triangles are proportional, the opposite angles
of their matching sides are equal.

. Ce . AB AC BC
Special Nomination: Let, in AABC and ADEF, DE DF EF It is to
prove that, ZA = 2D, /B=/E, /C=/F.

A D

Drawing: Consider the matching sides of the triangles ABC and DEF unequal.
Take two points P and @Q on AB and AC respectively, so that AP = DE and
AQ = DF. Join P and Q.
