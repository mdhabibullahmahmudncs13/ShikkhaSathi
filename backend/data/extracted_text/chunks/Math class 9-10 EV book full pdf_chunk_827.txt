temperatures are variable. Similarly, in example 2, the secured marks used in the
data are the variables.
Discrete and Indiscrete variable: The variables used in statistics are of two
types. Such as, discrete and indiscrete vari ables. The variables whose values
are only integers, are discrete variables. The marks obtained in example 2 are
discrete variables. Similarly, only integers are used in population indicated data.
That is why, the variables of data used for population are discrete variables. A
nd the variables whose numerical values can be any real number are indiscrete
variables. Such as, in example 1, the temperature indicated data which can be
any real number. Besides, any real number can be used for the data related to
