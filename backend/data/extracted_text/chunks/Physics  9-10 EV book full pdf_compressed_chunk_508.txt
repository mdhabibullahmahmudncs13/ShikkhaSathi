========================================

constants at all. It is reciprocal to the temperature (7), i.e., the less the
temperature is the more the expansion of solid will be! In other words, at a
definite pressure and a definite temperature the amount of expansion due to
increase of temperature by one degree is less than the expansion due to increase
- of temperature by one degree at the same pressure but at low temperature.
