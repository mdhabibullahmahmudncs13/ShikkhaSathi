Appendix 399
Theorem 5
Two diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
Proposition: Let the diagonals AC and BD of the rhombus
ABCD intersect at O. It is required to prove that, p ¢
(i) ZAOB = ZBOC = ZCOD = ZDOA = 1 right angle
(ii) 40 =CO, BO=DO. XT
Proof: 4 5
(1) A rhombus is a parallelogram. Therefore, [Diagonals of a
AO =CO, BO=DO. parallelogram bisect
each other]
(2) Now, in A AOB and ABOC,
AB =BC [ sides of a rhombus
AO =CO are equal |
and OB =0B. [ from (1) ]
So A4OB = ABOC . [ common side ]
[ SSS theorem ]
Therefore, ZA0B = ZBOC .
ZAOB + ZBOC = 1 straight angle = 2 right angles.
ZAOB = ZBOC =I right angle.
Similarly, it can be proved that, ZCOD = 2D0A = 1 right
angle. (Proved)
