tied by to the earth although it is revolving around the earth, neither is it falling

Translational motion

If an object moves in such a way that all the particles of the object travel the

same distance, at the same time, in the same direction then its motion is called

translational motion. Sometimes we see many examples of this type in our

surroundings. When something moves in a straight path then its example is very

common. If we do not consider the circular motion of the wheel of a car then

straight advancement of the car is an example of translational motion. At this

time every point of the car will travel the same distance, in equal time, in the

same direction.
