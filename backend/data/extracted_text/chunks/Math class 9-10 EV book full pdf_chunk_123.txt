Chapter 3. Algebraic Expressions 47
a? +2ab +b = (a+b)?
a’ —2ab+b* = (a —b)*
adding, 2a” + 2b* = (a +b)? + (a — b)?
or, 2(a® +b?) = (a +b)? + (a — b)*
ne? 02
Hence, (a® + %) = (a+) +(a=bf +9) _— b) O

Corollary 6. ab= ath) a=b
2 2
Proof: From Formula 1 and Formula 2,
a? +2ab+b* = (a+b)?
a’ —2ab+ b> = (a —b)*
subtracting, 4ab = (a + b)* — (a — b)?
2 2
or, ab = (a+b)? (a—b)
4 5 4 iN
a+b a—
hence, ab = | —— | — | —— [m}
ence, al ( 3 ) ( 3 )
Remark: By applying the Corollary 6 product of any two quantities can be
expressed as the difference of two squares.
Formula 3. a? —b* = (a+b)(a—b)
Therefore, the difference of the squares of two expressions = sum of two expressions
x difference of two expressions.
Formula 4. (z+ a)(z +b) = 2% + (a + b)x + ab
