A special type of IC is made to process digital signals. These IC’s have become
efficient gradually. That is, they can process a large number of signals at a very
short time accurately. Therefore, as time goes by, the process of digitizing is
becoming easier and it is needless to say that everything around us is being
converted into digital world. §
