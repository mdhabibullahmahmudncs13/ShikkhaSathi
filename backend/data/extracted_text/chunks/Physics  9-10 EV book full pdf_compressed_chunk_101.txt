1. Rashed, with his newly purchased scale, measured the length of his pencil and
the length came to 11.73 cm. His friend Sujon said that this measurement may
not be correct. Rashed said that he obtained the same result measuring by the
scale several times. When they went to the teacher, he instructed them to use a
vernier scale of constant 0.005 cm. Rashed measured the correct length by the
vernier scale.
(a) ~~ What is the vernier constant ?
(b) ~~ Why are units required to express the amount of a quantity?
(¢c) Find a division of vernier scale is equal to what number of divisions of
main scale.
(d) The frist measurement of length measured by Rashed was irrelevant to
accurate measurement, explain with logic.
