========================================

vibrations increase and the molecular bonds become weak. They start to move
rolling upon one another and we call it a liquid. If the temperature is increased
further, the molecules start to move freely. We called it a gas. Now we observe
this more deeply and we will be introduced to different quantities which are
related to the change of state of matter.
‘When heat is applied to a solid, its temperature goes up. (we will know later at
what rate the temperature will rise and on what factor it depends.)
If the temperature (at a definite pressure) reaches a definite value, the solid starts
to melt. This process is called fusion and the temperature at which the fusion
starts is called the melting point. If we continue to measure the temperature,
