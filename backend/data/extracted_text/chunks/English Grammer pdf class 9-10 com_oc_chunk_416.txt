Dear Shuvro,

It’s really, really good to be here in Sylhet. We got here on Saturday
evening. The journey was HORRIBLE, the bus moved like a local bus, it
stopped quite a few times to pick passengers. It was really irritating. It
took twelve hours to get here! But the place we're staying is very nice —
the surroundings are beautiful. I'm having a good time with my family
now, but | miss you a lot.

It’s now Tuesday afternoon and I’m sitting at a tea- garden chatting
with some local boys. The weather is fantastic! It can lift your spirit.

With lots of love,

Rupom
