25x — Te 28-10 18x 18
or, ———— ="—— or, —— = —
35 35 35 35
or, 18 =18 or, z=1
.. Solution is z = 1
Now, we shall solve such equations which are in quadratic form. These equations
are transformed into their equivalent equations by simplifications and lastly the
equations is transformed into linear equation of the form az = b. Again, even
if there are variables in the denominator, they are also transformed into linear
equation by simplification.
Example 2. Solve: (y—1)(y +2) = (y+ 4)(y — 2)
Solution: (y —1)(y +2) = (y + 4)(y — 2)
or, yt —y+2y—2=y>+4y—2y—8
or,y—2=2y—8
or, y — 2y = —8 + 2 [by transposition]
or, —y = —6
- or, y=06
9 I
& Solution is y = 6
