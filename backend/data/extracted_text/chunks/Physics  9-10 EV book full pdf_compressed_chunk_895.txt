move away the electromagnet always
by repulsion. When it moves away from the terminals of the main current, no
current flows in the electromagnet, then it continues its rotation due to inertia of
motion. g

For your understanding, it is presented in a easy way (Figure 12.11). In a
practical motor, there may be many coils around the armature and each coil gets
current from the commutator and the armature continues its rotation.
