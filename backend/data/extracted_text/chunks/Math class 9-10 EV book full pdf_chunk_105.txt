========================================

coordinate system. Usually values of independent variable is set along x axis, and
those of dependent variable along y axis.
In order to draw a graph for the function y = f(x), some values of independent
variable are chosen from domain, and with corresponding values of dependent
variables ordered pairs are formed. After that these ordered pairs are placed on
the plane. The resultant points are then connected with line which is known as
graph of the function y = f(x).
Example 22. Draw the graph for the function y = 2x, where —=3 <x <3
Solution: Calculate values of y for some values of x from the domain —3 < x < 3, pS
and draw a list. S
