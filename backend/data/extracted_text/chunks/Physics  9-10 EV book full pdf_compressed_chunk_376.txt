We are familiar with three states of matter- solids, liquids and gases. Among
them liquids and gases can flow so they are also called fluids. In this chapter we
will analyse and see how matter exerts pressure in its three states. Not only that,
elasticity is a special property of matter. We will also discuss how the property of
elasticity works in the solid, liquid and gaseous state.
Basides solid, liquid and gas, there is another state of matter named plasma, we
will also try to understand why this state is called the fourth state of matter.
