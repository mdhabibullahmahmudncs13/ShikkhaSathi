========================================

The required length of the diagonal is 24 metre and perimeter 52 metre.
Example 14. The lengths of two parallel sides of a trapezium are 91 cm and
51 cm and the lengths of two other sides are 37 cm and 13 em respectively.
Determine the area of the trapezium.
Solution:
Let, in trapezium ABCD; AB = 91cm. C'D = 51cm. D si C
Let us draw the perpendiculars DF and CF on AB
from D and C respectively. 13 37
.. CDEF is a rectangle.
SEF =CD=51cm A E91 F B
Let, AE =z and DE=CF =h
o.BF=AB—- AF =91—-(AE+EF)=91— (2 +51) =40— =z
From the right-angled AADE we get,
AE? + DE? = AD? or, 22 + h? = 132 or, 2 + 1h? = 169... (1)
Again in the-right angled triangle BC'F
BF? 4+ CF* = BC? or, (40 — 2)? + h? = 37°
w“
S$ or, 1600 — 80x + 2% + h? = 1369
