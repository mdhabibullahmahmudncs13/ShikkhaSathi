========================================

We use the to infinitive after some verbs connected with saying that we will or
will not do something, such as agree, refuse, offer, promise, etc.

e.g. Rahela had agreed to sell her computer at half price to
me, but refused to do so at the last moment. | offered to
give a slightly higher price, and she accepted that. |
promised not to make any more deals with her.

The negative form is not + to infinitive:
e.g. Remember not to drive too fast.
I've decided not to accept the offer.
