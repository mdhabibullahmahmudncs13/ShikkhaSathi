========================================

on the lake water. There were red and white water lilies in full bloom in the
lake. We were not the only ones watching the birds, there were about a
dozen more visitors who came to enjoy the scene. There was enchanting
sound of birds chirping, splashing water and fluttering winds all around us. It
was such a splendid experience!
It was almost 4 o'clock when we started back from there for Dhaka. By the
way, we had a wonderful lunch at the campus. There was a roadside eating
place just outside the campus gate that served the best rice and curry I've
ever had.
But no more today.
Love,
