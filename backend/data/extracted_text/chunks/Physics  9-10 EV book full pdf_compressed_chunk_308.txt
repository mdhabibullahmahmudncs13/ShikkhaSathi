4.3.2 Potential Energy
When we were discussing work, we said that if a force does a positive work on
an object then energy is generated. When we were talking about kinetic energy
we gave the example of this too. We have shown that by applying a force on an
object if the object moves by a distance, then its kinetic energy becomes Smv?
Now, we will give such an example L M
where force is applied and displacement '
occurs even when no kinetic energy is \
produced. Suppose, a spring is kept on a :
table as shown in figure 4.03. You L- i Xx I
applied a force at the free end of the ' !
spring by your finger and compressed it r=
by an amount x. In such a condition, none — re =.
of your hand or spring is in motion, so no F x A ar
