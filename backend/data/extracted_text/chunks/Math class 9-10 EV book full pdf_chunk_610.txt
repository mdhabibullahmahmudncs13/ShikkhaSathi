========================================

of two digits, the sum will be three times the digits of the tens place. Moreover,
if the places of the digits are interchanged, the number thus found will be 9 less
than the original number. Find the number.
Solution: Let the digit of the tens place of the required number be x and its
digits of the units place is y. Therefore, the number is 102 + y.
.. by the 1st condition, = +y +5 = 3x... (1)
and by the 2nd condition, 10y 4+ = = (10x +) — 9...(2)
From equation (1) we get, y = 3x — x — 5, or, y = 2x — 5... (3)
Again, from equation (2) we get,
1W0y—y+a—100+9=0
or, 9y — 9x +9 =0
or,y—z+1=0
or, 2z — 5 — x + 1 = 0 [putting the value of y from equation (3) we get]
or, xr =4
putting the value of 2 in equation (3) we get, y =2x4—-5=8-5=3
