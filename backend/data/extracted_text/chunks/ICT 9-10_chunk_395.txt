4. Python is a case-sensitive programming language. So, if the same letter is
lowercase and uppercase, Python will treat them as two different variables.
For example, My_variable and my_variable will be treated as two different

5. Keywords are saved words in Python programme. We cannot use keywords
as the name of variables or functions or any other identifiers. In Python 3.10,
there are 35 saved keywords. For example, False, True, None, and, as, break,
class, continue, if, else, except, while, return, for, global etc.
