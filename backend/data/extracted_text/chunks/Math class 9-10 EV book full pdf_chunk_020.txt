========================================

numbers and they are mutually Trime and ¢ > 1.
2g and z cannot be equal, that is 2¢ # Z
.v/2 cannot be expressed in the form ; , that is V2 # ;
.+/2 is an irrational number. o
Work: Prove that v/3 is an irrational number.
Example 2. Prove that when one is added to the product of 4 consecutive
natural numbers this becomes a perfect square.
Solution: Let the consecutive integers be x, x +1, © +2, +3
If we add 1 to the product of these 4 integers we get:
w(x +1)(z+2)(z +3) +1
=z(z+3)(z+1)(r+2)+1
= (2? +32) (a? + 3x +2) + 1
=a(a+2)+1 [Assume 2? + 32x =a |
g =a*+2a+1=(a+1)?=(2>+3z +1)?
