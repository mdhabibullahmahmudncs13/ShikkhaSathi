========================================

We have seen that some geometrical shapes have only line symmetry, some have
only rotational symmetry and some have both line symmetry and rotational
symmetry. For example, the square has four lines of symmetry as well rotational
symmetry of order 4.
The circle is the most symmetrical figure, because it can be rotated around its
centre through any angle. Therefore, it has unlimited order of rotational of
symmetry. At the same time, every line through the centre forms a line of
reflection symmetry and so it has unlimited number of lines of symmetry.
