========================================

only one division of the circular scale, the screw advances by = of the pitch.
Therefore, with this scale up to = mm = 0.01 mm of length measurement is
possible. This is called the least count of the screw gauge.

.. Now-a-days instead of the vernier scale, attached dials or digital slide calipers
£ are available by which lengths can be measured accurately.
