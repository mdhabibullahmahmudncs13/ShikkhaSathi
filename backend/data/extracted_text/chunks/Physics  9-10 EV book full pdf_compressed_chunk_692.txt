========================================

optical fibers are used in a process called endoscopy of medical science is
described in the last chapter.
Example
Question: If the refractive index of the ————————
core in an optical fiber is 1.50 and the _—
refractive index of the clad is 1.45, (Figure a Ng =
9.11) what is the angle of incidence of i mes
light for total internal reflection to occur? —
Answer: g, = sin™! (2) Figure 9.11: Total i I reflecti
