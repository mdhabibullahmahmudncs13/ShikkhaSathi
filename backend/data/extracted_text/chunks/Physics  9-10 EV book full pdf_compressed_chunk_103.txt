Motion

There are many kinds of motions around us. When a person rides a cycle, it's a
kind of motion. When a car moves, that is another kind of motion. When a plane
flies, it is also a motion. When the earth revolves round the sun, it is also a
motion. When a hanging bulb oscillates, it is a kind of motion. When a bullet
ejects from a rifle, it's a motion also. Apparently it seems that all these several
types of motions are of different types. But you will be surprised and happy to
know that all these motions can be explained by a few number of quantities. In
this chapter those quantities, their units, dimensions and the relationship among
them will be discussed.
