========================================

continuously. We might need these values in our different works, so we preserve
and analyze these values and send them from one place to another. To process
the data we might use electronics. This continuously changing data can be
converted into electrical signals and these types of signals are called analog
signals. If we process these signals with a type of electronics, it is called analog
electronics. When discrete signals are processed, then it is called digital signal.
Continuously changing information or data signals can be processed in a
different way. To do this, we have to find the value for a definite interval of time
and express this in a type of number. Then we have to preserve this value
successively. Then we will be able to process these numbers using electronics.
