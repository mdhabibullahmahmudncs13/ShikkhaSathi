‘When two surfaces intersect, a line is formed. For example, two faces of a box
meet at one side in a line. This line is a straight line. Again, if a lemon is cut by
a knife, a curved line is formed on the plane of intersection of curved surface of
the lemon.
Line: A line is one-dimensional; it has only length and no breadth or thickness.
If the width of a face of the box is gradually receded to zero, we are left with only
line of the boundary. In this way, we can get the idea of line from the idea of
surface.
