========================================

calculate the density of neutron or proton, it can be considered as the density of
the nucleus!
m 1.67 x 10727 kg 18 3
Density of nucleus, p= Fr ve 0.204 x 10'® kg/m"
zr? 3 (125x107 m)?
You need to guess how big this number is! One tea spoon contains
approximately 1 cc materials.
Therefore, mass of 1 tea spoon nucleus is:
m = 0.204 x 10*® kg/m*® x 107° m® = 2 x 10! kg
It is roughly the collective mass of all the people of the world. gd
