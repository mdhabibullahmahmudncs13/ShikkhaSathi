========================================

A; = 13 = [Ly + aly (T, = TD]?
Or Ap = 13 + 20L3(T, = Ty) + o2L3(T, = Ty)?
But A, =13
So, Ay = Ay + 204,(T, — Ty) + 0A, (T, — T;)?
We have seen that the value of a is very small, so the value of o? is smaller. In
fact it is so small that if we avoid the whole part with ¢?, then no problem will
arise in our analysis or calculation. So we can write:
Ay = Ay + 204,(T, — Ty)
But we know,
Ay = Ay + A(T, — Ty) a
