Answer: Kinetic energy of the object,
1 210x102 = 500
3 mv = 2 ]= ]
This energy will compress the spring, that is,
! kx? = 500
Zkx"=500]
therefore, v7 2 x500 m? = 1 m?

x=01m
When we raise anything, then it acquires potential energy. When a piece of stone
is released freely from above, its speed increases when it comes down. So it
develops a kinetic energy. This becomes possible because a kind of potential
© energy was stored in it when it was in the ‘above’ position. How much potential
