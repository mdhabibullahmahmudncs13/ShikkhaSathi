However, if the compiler finds any errors in the entire set of instructions, it
cannot proceed with the translation. Only when all instructions are error-free
can the compiler perform the translation.

b) Interpreter: In some translation systems, regardless of the number of instru
ctions we give, they will not be translated all at once. Instead, each instruc-
tion will be translated sequentially, one by one. This translation process is
called interpreting, and the program that performs this translation is called an
interpreter. The interpreter translates each instruction one at a time and will
stop if it encounters an error in any instruction.
