Since, if 4 students are seated in a bench, 3 benches remain vacant, the number
of benches of that class = hn +3
Again, since, if 3 students are seated in each bench, 6 students are to remain
. r—6
standing, the number of benches of that class = 5
Since the number of benches is fixed,
x r—6 r+12 2-6
therefore, — = a Me
herefore, 1 +3 3 or, 7 3
or, dr — 24 = 3x +36 or, dr — 3x = 36 + 24
or, x = 60
number of students of the class is 60
