State of Matter and Pressure 143
5.4 Air Pressure
Air has a certain pressure (Figure: 5.06). We do not feel this pressure distinctly
because a pressure is also exerted outside from inside of our bodies. So these two
pressures neutralize one another. There is no air in space, so there is no pressure
of air, so there is nothing to neutralize the inner pressure of our body and in such
an environment human bodies may explode instantly due to this inner pressure.
For this reason the astronauts always wear pressure protected space suits. The
pressure on the earth surface is 10°N/m?, which means if you imagine an area of
Im? on the earth surface, then the weight of the column of air on it is 10°N, this
is approximately the weight of an elephant !
