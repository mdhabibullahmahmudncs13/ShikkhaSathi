========================================

in case of light. As this is a wave consisting of electric and magnetic fields, so

light does not need any medium to travel. Light can create its wave of electric

and magnetic fields and can propagate by itself. So when we talked about the

first and second medium for reflection or refraction, one of this medium can

even be vacuum. To speak the truth, the examples we see for reflection and
“ refraction in glass or water, there, one medium is glass (or water) and other is air.
s Air is such a light medium that we can consider it as a vacuum.
