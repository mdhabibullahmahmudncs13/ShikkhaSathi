========================================

The tangent in figure (a) is a direct common one and P
in figure (c) it is a transverse common tangent.
If a common tangent to a circle touches both the
circles at the same point, the two circles are said ©
to touch each other at that point. In such a case,
the two circles are said to have touched internally or
externally according to their centres lie on the same oS
side or opposite side of the tangent. In figure (c) the
two circles have touched each other internally and in 3
figure (d) externally. @
Theorem 25. The tangent drawn at any point of a circle is perpendicular to
the radius through the point of contact of the tangent.
