direction. The frictional force always works in the direction reverse to that the
applied force! If some weight is put on the wooden piece it will be seen that the
frictional force is increased also, though the weight and the force of friction are
normal to each other.

We will see that there is nothing =
surprising in it if we understand — BEA)
how frictional forces are developed. i = i
Though apparently wood, table etc. I A]
(or the two surfaces where friction is i
present) seem very smooth, but if we |
view them with a microscope it will Fg"
be seen (Figure 3.16) that all
surfaces are rough or irregular. —
