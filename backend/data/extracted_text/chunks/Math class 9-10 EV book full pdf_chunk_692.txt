Construction 12. To divide a given line segment internally in a given ratio.
Special Nomination: Let the line segment AB
be divided internally in the ratio m : n.
Drawing: Let an angle BAX be drawn at Xx
A. From AX cut the lengths AE = m and C
EC = n sequentially. Join B,C. At E, draw py
line segment ED parallel to C'B which intersects m
AB at D. Then the line segment AB is divided
at D internally in the ratio m : n. i ’ "
Proof: Since the line segment DE is parallel to
a side BC of the triangle ABC.
AD: DB=AE:EC=m:n
‘Work: Divide a given line segment in definite ratio internally by an
alternative method.
Example 1. Divide a line segment of length 7 ¢ m internally in the ratio 3: 2.
Solution: Draw any ray AG. From AG, cut a
