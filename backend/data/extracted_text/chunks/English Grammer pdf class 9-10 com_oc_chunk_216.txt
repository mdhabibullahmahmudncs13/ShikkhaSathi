Gerund vs Participle
Gerund
People remain confused between gerund and participle because of their
similarities. Both are formed when ing is added to a verb. There is another
similarity, and that is the fact that both gerund and participle indicate some
action or state of being. However, there are differences between them that
will be highlighted in this article.
Participle
As indicated above, a participle can be made by adding ing to a verb. However,
it becomes a participle only when adding ing to the verb makes it function as
an adjective.
