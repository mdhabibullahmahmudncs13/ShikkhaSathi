Step 2. Triangle AC’ AD and rectangular region ADLM lie on the same base AD
and between the parallel lines AD and CL. Therefore, Rectangular region
ADLM=2ACA D [Theorem 37]
Step 3. ABAF and the square ACGF lie on the same base AF and
between the parallel lines AF and BG. Hence, square region ACGF =
2AFAB =2ACAD [Theorem 37]
Step 4. Rectangular region ADLM = square region ACGF.
Step 5. Similarly joining C, E' and A, K it can be proved that rectangular region
BELM = square region BCHK
Step 6. Rectangular region (ADLM + BELM) = square region ACGF+ square
region BCHK. or, square region ABED = square region ACGF+ square
region BCHK.
That is, AB? = BC? + AC? (Proved)
Construction 13. Construct a parallelogram with an angle equal to a definite
