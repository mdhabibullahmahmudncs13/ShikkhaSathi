Chapter 16. Mensuration 347
1. Area of the base = mr?
2. Area of the curved surface = perimeter of the base x height= 27rh
3. Area of the whole surface
= (mr? + 2mrh + mr?) = 27r(r + h)
4. Volume = Area of the base x height= 71h
Example 30. If the height of a right circular cylinder is 10 cm and radius of
the base is 7 cm, determine its volume and the area of the whole surface.
Solution: Let, the height of the right circular cylinder is 4 = 10 em and radius
of the base is 7.
Its volume = 72h
= 3.1416 x 7? x 10 = 1539.38 cube cm (approx.)
and the area of the whole surface = 27r(r + h)
= 2x 3.1416 x 7(7 + 10) = 747.7 square metre (approx.)
‘Work: Make a right circular cylinder using a rectangular paper. Determine
the area of its whole surface and the volume.
