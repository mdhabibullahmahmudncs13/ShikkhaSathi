Chapter 10. Distance and Elevation 217
Solution: Let, the height of the stick from the foot
leaned against the tree of AB = 7 metre and angle of
depression ZDBC = 30°.
oS LACB = ZDBC = 30° [alternate angle]
From right-angled AABC we get,
in ZACB AB in 30° 7

sin 2 = BC or, sin = BC D 300 B
or. 1_7 sina0e = xm Tm

"2 BC |” a)
SBC =14 C A
.. The required height of the stick is 14 metre.

‘Work:

In the figure, if depression angle ZCAE = 60°, Tr E

elevation angle ZADB = 30°, AC = 36 metre, “

AB L DC and D, C, B lic on the same straight "
