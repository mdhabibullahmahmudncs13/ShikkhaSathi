Chapter 3. Algebraic Expressions 65
Example 32. Resolve into factors: 54z* + 27z%a — 162 — Sa.
Solution: Let, f(r) = 54a’ + 27z%a — 162 — 8a
4 3
Then, i(- 1) = wo - i) van — i) — uo — ») — 8a
“Tu Tits sa—sa=0
or — ( — i) =z+ : = Low +a) is a factor of f(x).
Hence, (22 4 a) is a factor of f(x).
Now, 54a? + 272%a — 16x — 8a
=272%(2z + a) — 8(2z + a)
= (27+ a)(272° — 8)
— (20+ {GaP — (2%)
= (27 + a)(3x — 2)(92% + 67 + 4)
Example 33. g(a) =a®+a® + 10a — 8, f(a) =a®*— 9+ (a+ 1)*.
1) If g(a) is divided by (a — 2),then determine the remainder,
2) Resolve into factors: f(a).
Solution: 1) Given, g(a) = a® + a* + 10a — §
According to remainder theorem, if g(a) is divided by (a — 2), then the remainder
will be (2).
G2) =P 42410. 2-8=8+4420-8=32—8=24
cg(2)=24
