========================================

transistor would change the whole world.
A transistor can work just like a vacuum tube, but compared with a vacuum tube
it is very small in size, light in weight, and a very small amount of electricity is
needed to operate it, it is very reliable and most of all, it can be made at a very
low cost. Thus it rapidly secured its place, replacing the vacuum tube and the
people of the world began to get many electrical appliances by using this
transistor at very cheap.
13.2.3 Integrated Circuit
Although the discussion about an integrated circuit was started in 1952, a real
integrated circuit was started to be made in the sixth decade. In the fifth decade
many transistors were made on a thin silicon plate (Wafer) and eventually the
