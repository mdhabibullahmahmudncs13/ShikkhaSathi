a transistor but also creating a diode, resistor and a capacitor on a wafer, a
complete circuit was started to be made. This circuit was named an integrated
circuit (IC). With the development of technology many transistors were
assembled in a small area, and first it was named Large Scale Integration (LSI),
and then it is called Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI). These circuits were
made into a ready-made package so that they could be directly used in a circuit
board. Modern equipment such as the Micro-computer, clinical appliances,
video camera, communication satellite would never be possible without the use
of integrated circuits.
