========================================

where AB = BE. ! ’ “
It should be mentioned that, if AABC and 4 »
ADEF are congruent, we write AABC =
ADEF. In this case, the arca of the triangular
region AABC = area of the triangular region pa Pp
ADEF. »
But, two triangles are not necessarily congruent aN 9
when they have equal areas. For example, in NN
the figure, area of AABC = area of ADBC but |
AABC and ADBC' are not congruent, > y
Theorem 36. The areas of all triangular regions having same base and lying
between the same pair of parallel lines are equal to one another.
Let, the triangular regions ABC and DBC stand ©, A =P
on the same base BC' and lie between the pair of ~~]
parallel lines BC and AD. It is required to prove —
that, Aregion ABC = A region DBC. B rd
