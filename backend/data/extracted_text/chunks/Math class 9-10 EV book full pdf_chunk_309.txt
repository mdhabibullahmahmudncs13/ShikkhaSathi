Chapter 6. Lines, Angles and Triangles 127
Straight angle
The angle made by two opposite rays at their
common end point is a straight angle. In the adjacent
figure, a ray AC is drawn from the end point A of the «<o———e—e—>
ray AB. Thus the rays AB and AC have formed an ¢ A B
angle ZBAC at their common point A. ZBAC is a
straight angle. The measurement of a right angle is
2 right angles or 180°.
Adjacent angle
If two angles in a plane have the same vertex, a
common side and the angles lie on opposite sides of B c
the common side, each of the two angles is said to be
an adjacent angle of the other.
In the adjacent figure, the angles ZBAC and ZCAD
have the same vertex A, a common side AC and A D
are on opposite sides of AC. ZBAC and ZC AD are
adjacent angles.
