========================================

into matter. It is possible to stop a normal beta particle by a few millimeter thick
aluminum sheet.
‘When radiation of beta particles occurs, a proton is increased in the nucleus by
deducting of a neutron. So the number of nucleons remains the same. As the
atomic number depends on the number of protons, the atomic number of the
nucleus increases, and hence a different nucleus of a different element is formed.
For example: radioactive C , is converted into N,, due to beta radiation:
