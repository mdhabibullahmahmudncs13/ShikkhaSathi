========================================

We should remember that Newton’s second law of motion is true not only for
linear motion, but this is true for any type of motion. We have known about grav-
itational force, by using Newton’s second law, we will be able to explain the
motion of the planets revolving around the sun due to the gravitational force. But
in this book, we will limit the use of Newton’s second law only to linear motion.
If force is applied on an object, then by using Newton’s second law, its
acceleration can easily be determined. (If force is divided by mass, acceleration
can be found). If acceleration is known, the velocity or distance travelled

.
can be determined by using the laws of motion. a
