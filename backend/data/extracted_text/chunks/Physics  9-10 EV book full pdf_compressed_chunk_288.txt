========================================

(d) What is the change in acceleration in frictional and frictionless
floors? Explain mathematically.

2. An object of mass 5 kg moving in linear motion with a velocity of 5 m/s
hits another object and changes the momentum of the second object by an
amount 4 kg m/s. The masses of both objects remain unchanged after the
collision.

(a) Which property of matter is a measure of inertia?
(b) What do you mean by the statement ‘The applied force is proportional to the
change of momentum’?
(c) What is the final velocity of the first object?
(d) When there is no change in momentum, then comment about
the second object by mathematical analysis.
