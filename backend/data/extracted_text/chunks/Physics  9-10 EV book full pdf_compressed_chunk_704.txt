the angle with which the light ray is
falling. If we know the three special rules of refraction of light, we can explain
how the image is formed:
(i) If the ray of light is centripetal (Figure 9.20, YO or XO ray) it goes
straight after refraction.
(ii) The rays which are parallel with the principle axis, (Figure 9.20 XP) will
(PS) appear to diverge from the focal point (F) after refraction.
