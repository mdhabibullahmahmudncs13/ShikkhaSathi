Classification of Real Numbers
Natural Number: 1,2,3,4,... etc are natural numbers or positive whole numbers.
2,3,5,7,.... are primes and 4,6,8,9, ..... etc are composite numbers. If GCD
(Greatest Common Divisor) of two integers is 1 then they are called mutually
primes. For example 6 and 35 are mutually primes.
Integer: All positive and negative fractionless numbers are said to be integers.
For example, ...,—3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,... etc are integers.
Fractional Number: Numbers expressible as P are said to be factional numbers
q
LL 1 3 -5 4
where ¢ # 0, ¢ # 1 and p are not divisible by ¢. For example, 233% ete
are simple fractional numbers. In case of a simple fraction Ed if p < ¢, then the
q
fraction is called proper and if p > ¢ then the fraction is termed improper. For
