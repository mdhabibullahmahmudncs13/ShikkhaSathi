Example 20. Find domain and range of the relation

S={(2,1),(2,2), (3,2), (4,5)}.

Solution: Given, S = {(2,1),(2,2).(3,2),(4.5)}

The first elements of the ordered pairs of S are 2,2,3,4 and the second elements

are 1,2,2,5

Dom S ={2,3,4} and Range S = {1,2,5}

Example 21. If A= {0,1,2,3} and R= {(z,y) :x € Aye Aand y = z+ 1},

then express R in tabular method and determine Dom R and Range R.

Solution: Given, R={(z.y):x€ A,ye A y=a+1}

From the conditions of R we get y = + 1.

Now for each x € A determine the value of y = = + 1.
