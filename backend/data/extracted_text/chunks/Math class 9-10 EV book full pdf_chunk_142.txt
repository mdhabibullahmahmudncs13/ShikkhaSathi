Factorization
If an expression is equal to the product of two or more expressions, each of the
latter expressions is called a factor of the former expression. After finding the
possible factors of any algebraic expression and then expressing the expression as
the product of these factors are called factorization or resolution into factors.
The algebraic expressions may consist of one or more terms. So, the factors may
