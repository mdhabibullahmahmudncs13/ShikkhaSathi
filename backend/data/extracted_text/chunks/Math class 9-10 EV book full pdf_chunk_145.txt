Work: Resolve into factors:

Middle term factorization: Factors can be determined by applying the
formula 2? + (a + b)x + ab = (x + a)(x + b). In this method, a polynomial of the
form 2° + pa + ¢ can be factorized, if two integers a and b can be found so that,
a+b =pand ab = q. For this, two factors of ¢ with their signs are to be taken
whose algebraic sum is p. If ¢>0 , a and b will be of same sign and if ¢< 0 , a and
b will be of opposite sign. To be noted p and ¢ may not be integers.
Example 24. Resolve into factors: z* + 12x + 35
Solution: #2 +122 +35 =a? + (5+ Nx +5 x T= (z+ 5) (xz +7)
Example 25. Resolve into factors: z% +z — 20
Solution: 22 +x — 20 = 2% + (5 — 4) + (5)(—4) = (z + 5)(z — 4) g
