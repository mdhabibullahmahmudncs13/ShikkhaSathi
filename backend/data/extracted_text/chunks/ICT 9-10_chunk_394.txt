========================================

There are a few things to keep in mind when naming variables:

1. The name of the variable will always be a word. That is, we cannot write the name
ofthe variable with more than one word. However, if you want, you can exclude the
spaces between the two words and give them the name of the variable as a word.
Again, the variable can also be named with an underscore ( _ ) sign between two
words, omitting the space between them.

2. The first letter of a variable's name must be a-z or A-Z or underscore (_). The first
letter cannot be a number (0-9) or any other symbol (e.g. * or etc.). However, after
the first letter, any number (0-9) or a-z or A-Z or underscore ( _ ) can be used as the
remaining letters,

3. No other symbols such as @, $, %,», etc. can be used in the name of the variable. g
