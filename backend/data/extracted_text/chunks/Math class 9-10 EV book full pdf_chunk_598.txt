Both the equations will be satisfied by the coordinates of that point. The very
coordinates of the point of intersection will be the solution of the two equations.
Example 8. Solve and show the solution in graph:
2r+y=28
3x —2y=5
Solution: Given equations are:
2 4y—8=0...(1)
3x —2y—5=0...(2)
By the method of cross-multiplication we get,
[3 _ y _ 1
Ix (=5)—(=2) x (=8) (8) x3—(-5)x2 2(-2)—-3x1
x _ y _ 1
