Problem Solving through Programming 125
From here we understand that the information stored in the variable named
test variable is 73.07 and its data type is float,
During programming there may be times when the data type of a variable needs
to be changed or specified. This can be done by casting. This is done using the
casting constructor function in Python
Three important type casting functions are mentioned below.
int()- creates integers from floats or strings.
float()- creates fractional numbers from strings, floats or integers.
str()-creates sirings [rom different data types.
Now consider the following examples
x=innl} # the value of x willbe | |= foat(l}  #the valisofxwill be 10 | x= sts 1") she value of x will be 51!
