========================================

body will sink in water. But it seems that the weight of the body when immersed
is less than its real weight.
If the weight of displaced water can be made just equal to the weight of the
object anyway, then the object remains there where it is put in water, it will not
float above or even sink below. In our everyday life though it is not seen by us
but for the movement of the submarine under water this is done. 3
