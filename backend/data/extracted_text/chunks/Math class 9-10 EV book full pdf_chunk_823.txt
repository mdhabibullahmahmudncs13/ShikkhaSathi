Hence the range = (14 —6) +1 =9
If the class interval is considered to be 3, the numbers of class will be 2 or 3
Considering 3 to be the class interval, if the data are arranged in 3 classes, the
frequency table will be:
Temperature (in celcius) | Tally

‘Work: Form two groups of all the students studying in your class. Find the
frequency distribution table of the weights (in Kgs) of all the members of the
groups.
Cumulative Frequency: In Example 1 considering 3 the class interval and
determining the number of classes, the frequency distribution table has been made.
The number of classes of the mentioned data is 3. The limit of the first class is
6° — 8°. The lowest range of the class is 6° and the highest range is 8°. The
