Verbs and Tenses 39

Use

We use the present continuous to talk about

- things which are happening now:

I'm having lunch right now. Laila is talking on the phone.
- things which are happening during this period of time, but not

necessarily at the moment:

She is working very hard these days. She is attending a training

programme.

- repeated events:

My two sons are always fighting. She is always losing things.

- things that people plan to do in the future:

Rina is going to the museum tomorrow.
We are leaving for London next week.

Activity 1 Read the passage in Presentation-A again and discuss in pairs in
what sense each of the verbs in the present continuous has
been used.
