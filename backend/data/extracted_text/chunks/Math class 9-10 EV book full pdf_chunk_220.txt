Note: Now observe from the following table: If there is no integral part of
a number and the number has k& 0's immediately after decimal point, then the
characteristic of the logarithm of the number is {—(k + 1)}.
If any characteristic is negative, ‘—’ sign is not placed on the left of the
characteristic, rather ‘—" (bar sign) over the characteristic. Such as,
characteristic —3 will be written as 3. Otherwise, whole part of the log including
mantissa will be negative.
