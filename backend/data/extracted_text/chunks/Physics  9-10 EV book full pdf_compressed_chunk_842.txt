Current Electricity 317
Current / flows from the battery
cell. This current goes to point B and
splits into two parts / and 7, and A 8 c
flows through the resistances R, and I==3,
R, respectively, then at point E the h
f Vv
currents converge into / and go back l Ra
to the battery as I. We have already
said that the current comes from the —|
battery and flows through the circuit F
E D
and then goes back to the battery. No =
electric current can be created or
destroyed except this in a circuit. So Figure 11.13: Two parallel resistances are
shown in a circuit.
I=1 +1,
Now we can find /, and /,:

Rh RR

* RR R
Therefore,
I=1+1 rtm (at a)
CTP ROR, RR,
So in this case also, we can define an equivalent resistance R, where
