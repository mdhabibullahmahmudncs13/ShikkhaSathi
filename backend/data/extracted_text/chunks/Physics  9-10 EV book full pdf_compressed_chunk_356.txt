Figure 4.06: Energy production from nuclear reaction
In this reaction, the three neutrons that have come out, actually come out with
huge speed, so the other uranium (330) nuclei cannot capture them very
easily. If by some means their kinetic energy can be lowered, then they will be
captured by other uranium (233U) nuclei and thus will break it creating some
more energy and releasing three new neutrons. In a nuclear power plant, this
work is done, so when the speed of the emerging neutrons goes down, they again
break other nucleuses and this process continues. This process is called a chain
reaction.
In this process, a huge amount of heat energy is produced, using this heat energy
water is vaporized and turbine is rotated with the help of this vapor and
