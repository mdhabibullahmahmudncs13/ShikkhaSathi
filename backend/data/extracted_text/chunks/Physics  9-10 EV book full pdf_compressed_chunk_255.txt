anywhere, remember that you attract the whole earth towards you when you fall
downwards. (As small as the acceleration of the earth may be, you pulled the
whole earth towards you, you may be little proud of it!)
The easiest way of understanding Newtons third law is to understand the
mechanism of our walking. We can all walk but nobody knows the physics
hidden behind this. Since you have started to learn physics a simple question can

from a stationary position, so you have
an acceleration, that means force has 5
been applied on you. But all of us know g 7
that nobody is applying a force on us. { EN
We walk by ourselves. How is that AM
