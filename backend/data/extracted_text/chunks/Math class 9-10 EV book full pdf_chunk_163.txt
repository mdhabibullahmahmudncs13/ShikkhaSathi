different ways. These problems are described linguistically. In this section, we
shall discuss the formation of algebraic formulae and their applications in solving
different problems of real surroundings which are described linguistically. As a

about the application of mathematics in real surroundings, on the other hand,
they will be eager to learn mathematics for their understanding of the
