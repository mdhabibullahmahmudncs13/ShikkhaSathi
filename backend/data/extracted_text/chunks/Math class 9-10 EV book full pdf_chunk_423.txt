Let PT be a tangent at the point P to the circle with
centre O and OP is the radius through the point of
contact. It is required to prove that, PT" L OP. A
Drawing: Take any point @Q on PT and join
0,Q. PQ
Proof: Since PT is a tangent to the circle at the point P, hence every point on
PT except P lies outside the circle. Therefore, the point @) is outside of the circle.
OQ is greater than OP that is, OQ > OP and it is true for every point ) on
the tangent PT except P.
.. So, OP is the shortest distance from the centre O to PT.
Therefore, PT 1. OP [Among all the line segments drawn from an external point
to a straight line, the perpendicular is the shortest] (Proved)
Corollary 8. At any point on a circle, only one tangent can be drawn.
