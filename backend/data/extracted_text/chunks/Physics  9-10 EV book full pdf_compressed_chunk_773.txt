10.7 Capacitor

When a conductor is charged or electricity is applied to it, it attains an equipoten-
tial state. Furthermore, bringing another charged object near a conductor will
induce a charge on that conductor. The potential of a conductor depends on the
charges around it. When heat is applied to a material, the resulting temperature
change depends on its specific heat capacity. If the heat capacity is high, the tem-
perature will increase only slightly, even with substantial heat input; conversely,
a substance with a low heat capacity will experience a significant rise in tempera-
ture with minimal heat added.
