========================================

know opposite charges attract each other, so to attract the pieces of paper

opposite charge of the comb has to be created in the paper. Since we know the

pieces of paper have no charge, then why is the comb attracting them?

This happens due to a process called electric induction. If charge is

accumulated in glass or plastic and brought near a neutral body, then charge will

be produced in the neutral body. To explain it, a metal sphere is shown in Figure

10.04 and kept on a non-conducting stand. Now if positive charge is

accumulated in a glass rod by rubbing it carefully with silk, and this is brought

near the sphere, negative charges of the sphere will come closer due to attraction
