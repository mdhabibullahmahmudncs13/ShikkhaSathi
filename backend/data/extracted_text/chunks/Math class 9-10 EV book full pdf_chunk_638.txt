Chapter 13. Finite Series 275
Example 4. 14+2+3+4+ +99 = what?
Solution:
The first term of the series a = 1, common difference d = 2 — 1 = 1 and the last
term p = 99.
It is an arithmetic series.
Let the nth term of the series = 9
We know, nth term of an arithmetic progression = a + (n —1)d
coat (n—1)d=99
or, 14 (n—1)1=99
or, 1+n—-1=99
con =99
From (4) formula, the sum of first n-terms of an arithmetic series,
Sp = Hea +(n—1)d}
Hence, the sum of first 99 terms of the series Sgg = Pre x1+(99—-1) x1} =
20 +98)
= 20 _ 99 50 = 4950
Alternative method: From formula (3), S, = Za +p)
Seg = 2a +99) = Bx = 4950
Example 5. What is the sum of first 30 terms of the series 7+ 12 + 17 +---?
Solution: First term of the series a = 7, common difference d = 12-7 =75
