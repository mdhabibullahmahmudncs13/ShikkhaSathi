5.6 Three States of Matter: Solid, Liquid and Gas
You certainly know that, everything of the universe is made of molecules!
(In fact, molecules are not fundamental particles, molecules consist of atoms,
atom consists of electros and nucleus, nucleus consists of protons and neutrons,
proton and neutron consists of quarks and the scientists are assuming that
electrons or quarks are made of strings!). Since, the properties of a matter exist
