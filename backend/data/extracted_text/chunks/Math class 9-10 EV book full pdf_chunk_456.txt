========================================

OP of APOM do not depend on the position of the

point P on the side OA.

If we draw the perpendiculars PM and PM; from a

two points P and Py to the side OX, two similar ¢y M Mi xX

triangles APOM and AP,OM, are formed.

Now, APOM and AP,OM, are being similar,
