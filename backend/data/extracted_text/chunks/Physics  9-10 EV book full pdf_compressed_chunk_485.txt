Effect of Heat on Matter 167
9Tx — 9 x 273.15° = 5T — 5 x 32°
If 7, and 7; are equal then we get,
4Ty = 9 x 273.15° — 5 x 32°
Ty = 574.59K

Question: What is the temperature in Celsius if the temperature of a healthy

body is 98.4 °F?

Answer: The relation between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature is

Te = > (Tp — 32°)
[a 9 F
If 7, = 98.4°, we get
5
Te = 5(98.4° — 32°) = 36.89°
(i.e., it is nearly equal to 37°C)

Question: At which temperature the readings in Celsius and Kelvin scale are

equal?

Answer: Never.

6.3 Thermal Expansion of Matter

6.3.1 Expansion of Solids:

Volume of almost all objects increases to some extent if they are heated. It is not

difficult to understand the cause of heat and temperature if we explain them with
