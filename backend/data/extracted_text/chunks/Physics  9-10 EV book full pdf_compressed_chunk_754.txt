Figure 10.10 : (a) Distance between +1C and -1C is 10cm (b) Distance
between +5C and +3C is 1m.
Question: Two charges of +5 C and +3 C are placed at a distance of 1 m. Now
a third charge +q is placed in between them, where will it not feel any force.
(Figure 10.10 b).
Answer: The +5 C charge will repel +q charge towards the right and the +3 C
charge repel towards the left. When two charges will repel by equal force, +q
charge will not feel any force.
