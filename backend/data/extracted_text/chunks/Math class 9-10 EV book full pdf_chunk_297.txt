Remarks: The postulates from 1 to 5 are called incidence postulates.
The concept of distance is also an elementary concept. It is assumed that,
Postulate 6:
1) Each pair of points P and @ determines a unique real number which is
known as the distance between point P and @ and is denoted by PQ.
2) If P and @ are different points, the number PQ is positive. Otherwise,
PQ =0.
3) The distance between P and ) and that between @ and P are the same,
ie. PQ =QP.
Since PQ = QP, this distance is called the distance between point P and point
Q. In practical, this distance is measured by previously determined unit.
According to postulate 5(c) one to one correspondence can be established
