Chapter 8. Circle 179

hypotenuse PO = hypotenuse PO and OA = OB [." Radius of the same circle]
. APAO = APBO [Hypotenuse-side unanimity of right angled
triangle]
o. PA=PB (Proved)

Remarks:

1. If two circles touch each other externally, all the points of one excepting the
point of contact will lie outside the other circle.
2. If two circles touch each other internally, all the points of the smaller circle

excepting the point of contact lie inside the greater circle.

Theorem 27. If two circles touch each other externally, the point of contact of

the tangent and the centres are collinear.

Let the two circles with centres at A and B touch

cach other externally at O. It is required to prove r

that the points A, O, B are collinear.
