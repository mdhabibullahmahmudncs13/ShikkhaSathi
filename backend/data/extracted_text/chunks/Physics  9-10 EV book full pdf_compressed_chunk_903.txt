Magnetic Effects of Current 341
12.3.2 Transformer
Changing a magnetic field creates
current— this property is used to J —
prepare transformer. In Figure L =
12.13 a rectangular iron core is 68 Zo
shown to understand how a PF TF
transformer works. Conducting =
wires have been winding on the
two sides of the core of course Figure 12.13: If AC potential is applied
there are insulating covers on the in primary coil of a transformer, it
conducting wires, so that if it produces potential in the secondary coil
touches anything metallic a short
circuit doesn’t occur. In the figure, we see that on the left side of the core an AC
voltage source is connected. Since the wire is connected by winding the iron
