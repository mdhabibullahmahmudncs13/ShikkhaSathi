0A =0B [.- radius of same circle]
and OM = OM [common side]
Therefore, AOAM = AOBM [SSS theorem]
LOMA =/Z0MB
Step 2. Since the two angles together make a straight angle and are equal.
Therefore, ZOMA = ZOM B = 1 right angle.
Therefore, OM 1 AB. (Proved)
Corollary 1. The perpendicular bisector of any chord passes through the centre
of the circle.
Corollary 2. A straight line can not intersect a circle in more than two points.
‘Work:
The theorem 17 opposite of the theorem states as follows:
the perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord.
Prove the theorem.
Theorem 18. All equal chords of a circle are equidistant from the centre.
Let AB and C'D be two equal chords of a circle with »
