neutrons. For example: an isotope of uranium turns into thorium by emitting an
alpha particle.

The atomic number of uranium is 92 and thorium is 90. It is notable that number
of electrons of an atom is not significant. Radioactive nuclei of atoms can
easily give up or receive extra electrons to and from its surroundings.

Figure 13.01: It is possible to stop an alpha particle by a single sheet of paper,
because it can lose its energy by too much ionizing. It is necessary to stop beta ray or
electrons using an aluminum sheet of a few millimeter thick. A thick lead sheet is
needed to stop gamma ray.
