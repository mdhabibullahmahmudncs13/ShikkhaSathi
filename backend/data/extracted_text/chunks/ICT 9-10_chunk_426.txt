========================================

an elif statement, the appropriate statement is selected based on a conditional or
relational expression. But, in a match statement, the appropriate statement is
usually selected based on the value of a valid variable. The format of the match
statement is:
match MatchFxp:
case valuel :
Blackl
case Value2 :
Blzck2
case Valued :
Blackd
case _ :
DefaultBlock
Blockl
Here, the expression used with the match statement is called match expression
matchExp. In the case statement, possible values for the match expression mat-
chExp variable are provided. There should be at least one space between the case
keyword and the possible values of the match expression variable, and it ends
with a colon. A case statement usually has a default statement at the end, which
ends with a colon,
