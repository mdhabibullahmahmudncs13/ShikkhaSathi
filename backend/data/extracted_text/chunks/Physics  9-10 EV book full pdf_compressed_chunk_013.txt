from our known potential energy, kinetic energy, gravitational energy or
electromagnetic energy.
1.2 Scope of physics
Since physics is the oldest and the most fundamental branch and other branches

physics is very vast. Not only that, different technologies have flourished based
on different laws of physics and we are using these in our daily lives (there are
examples of some instruments used in medical science in the final chapter). At
