the ratio of the fifth term to the fourth term = 6= 2.
So, this series is a geometric series. In this series, the ratio of any term to its
antecedent term is always equal. The common ratio of the mentioned series is
2. The numbers of terms of the series are finite. That is why the series is finite
geometric series.
The geometric series is widely used in different areas of physical and
biological science, in organizations like Banks and Life Insurance etc,
and in different branches of technology.
If the numbers of terms are not fixed in a geometric series, it is called an infinite
geometric series. The first term of a geometric series is generally expressed by a
and common ratios by 7. So by definition, if the first term is a, the second term
