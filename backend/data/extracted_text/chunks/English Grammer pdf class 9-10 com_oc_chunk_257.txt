iii) Noun Clauses: Some subordinate clauses function as nouns in
sentences.

Such clauses are called noun clauses. A noun clause may

function as a subject, a predicate nominative, a direct object, an

indirect object, an object of a preposition, or an appositive.

Examples:

Subject That he is generous is evident.

Predicate Nominative That is what we decided.

Direct Object | don’t know where Seema is.

Indirect Object Give whoever is coming a message.

Object of a Preposition | was criticized for what I did.

Appositive The subject of my speech, that taxes
should be lowered, was well
received.
