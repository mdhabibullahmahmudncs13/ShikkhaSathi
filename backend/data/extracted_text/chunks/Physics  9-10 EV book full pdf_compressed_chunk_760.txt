========================================

acceleration without beginning from gravitational force separately. Multiplying
that acceleration with mass, we determine force.
In case of electric force, we can do that, we can define a new quantity called
electric field. Multiplying charge ¢ with this, we will get the force F acting on it.
Therefore, any charge g creates an electric field around it. That electric field E
is:
