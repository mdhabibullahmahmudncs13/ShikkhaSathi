========================================

(i) If the rays of light is centripetal (Figure 9.23, YO or XO ray) it goes

straight after refraction.

(ii) The rays which are parallel with the principle axis, (Figure 9.23, XO) will

(CT) pass through focal point (F) after refraction.

(iii) If the direction of the light ray is reversed then it goes back the way it
came. Therefore, if any ray goes (Figure 9.23, TC) through the focus then
it will be refracted in parallel (CX)

Now we can form the image for a convex lens.
