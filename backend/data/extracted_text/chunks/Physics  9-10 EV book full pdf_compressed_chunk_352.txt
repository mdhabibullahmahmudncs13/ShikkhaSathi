========================================

form of heat energy and this cannot be regained for further use. This dissipation
of energy actually is not the limitation of technology. It is a rule restricted by
physics.
At the very beginning of learning science many don’t know it and they try to
make an everlasting machine for transformation of energy from one form to
another form. (A motor is rotating the generator and producing electricity, again
using this electricity the motor is rotating. This is an example of perpetual
machine. It will never work).
4.6 Relation between mass and energy
You know, in the theory of relativity by Einstein it is said that the mass of
an object and the energy are identical things. If the mass m is transformed into
energy, then this energy is E, and its amount is £ = mc?, here c is the light
