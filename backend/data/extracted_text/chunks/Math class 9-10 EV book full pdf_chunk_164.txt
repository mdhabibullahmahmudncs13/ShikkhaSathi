Chapter 3. Algebraic Expressions 67
2. One of the unknown quantities is to be denoted with any variable (say x).
Then realising the problem well, express other unknown quantities in terms

of the same variable x.

3. The problem will have to be splitted into small parts and express them by

algebraic expressions.

4. Using the given conditions, the small parts together are to be expressed by

an equation.

5. The value of the unknown quantity = is to be found by solving the equation.
Different formulae are used in solving the problems based on real life. The formulae
are mentioned below :
