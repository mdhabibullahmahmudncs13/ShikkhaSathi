2) The table to determine mode is given below:
[Class [31 —40[41 — 50]51 — 60[61 — 70[71 — 80[81 — 90[91 — 100
Frauenyl 4 | 6 | 5 | | 9 | 7 | 4

Mode = L + ——— x h

Here, the maximum numbers of repetition of frequency is 12 which lies in
the class (61-70).
CS L=6lf1=12-8=4f,=12-9=3h=10
Mode = 614+ —— x 10 = 61+ Sx 10 = 61+ 2 _ 6115.7 = 66.7

Required mode 66.7

Using convenient scaling along X axis where —“— (sign indicates 0 — 30
and taking per square unit as 5 units of cumulative frequency along Y axis
points along higher limits of classes have been marked. Then these marked
