========================================

per second. Therefore, f = : . if time period is expressed in second, then unit of
f will be Hertz (Hz).
In simple harmonic motion, amplitude is the maximum upward (or downward)
distance. The maximum displacement is called amplitude. As shown in figure
7.01, here the amplitude is a.
The next term is phase. When the mass attached to the spring is moving up and
down, if we follow the mass at any instant, we will see that it will stay in a
certain position from the equilibrium; this position is its phase. In simple
harmonic motion this definite condition of the mass and the spring will return
identically just after one time period. In terms of physics, we can say in simple
harmonic motion the phase that develops at any instant, after one time period,
this phase returns again.
