Practical Geometry
In the previous classes geometrical figures were drawn in proving different
propositions and in the exercises. There was no need for precision in drawing
these figures. But sometimes precision is necessary in geometrical constructions.
For example, when an architect makes a design of a house or an engineer draws
different parts of a machine, high precision of drawing is required. In such
geometrical constructions, one makes use of ruler and compasses only. We have
already learnt how to construct triangles and quadrilaterals with the help of
ruler and compasses. In this chapter we will discuss the construction of some
special triangles and quadrilaterals.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —
