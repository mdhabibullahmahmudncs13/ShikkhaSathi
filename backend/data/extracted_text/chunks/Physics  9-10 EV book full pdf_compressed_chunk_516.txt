========================================

During the change of state of matter, the transformation from solid to liquid and
from liquid to solid happens at a particular temperature. But without reaching
that particular temperature a substance can transform from solid to liquid, liquid
to gas or directly from solid to gas. It is not difficult to understand this if we go
back to the molecular model of a substance. If a molecule somehow gets
sufficient energy and due to this, its kinetic energy is increased sufficiently then
the molecule may come out from the surface of solid or liquid substance. Since
a large number of molecules from air are continuously striking the surface of
solid or liquid, so sometimes some of the molecules of solids or liquids may
obtain the required energy to become free. The more the surface area is, the
