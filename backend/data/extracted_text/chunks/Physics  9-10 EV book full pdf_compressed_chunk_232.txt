========================================

a=—== wg m/s
(b) velocity after 10's,
v=u+at=0+ 20 x10m/s =200m/s
(c) force is applied up to 10 s, since force is applied no more, therefore, after
reaching the velocity of 200 m/s, its velocity will be unchanged. That is,
velocity after 20 s is 200 m/s.
(d) distance travelled in 20 s has to be determined in two steps. Distance
travelled in the first 10's,
= 1 2 1 2 —
Sp = ut +cat =;%x20x 10°m = 1000 m
Distance travelled in the second 10s,
s;, = vt = 200 Xx 10m = 2000 m
Total distance travelled,
s =s;+ 5s, = 1000m + 2000 m = 3000 m = 3 km
(e) Shown in figure 3.06.
