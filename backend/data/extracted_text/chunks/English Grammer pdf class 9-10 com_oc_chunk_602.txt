========================================

The mouse heard the lion’s roar, recognized his friend's voice, and came to
help. His sharp teeth cut the ropes, setting the lion free. {82 words)
Note: The writer of a summary must be able to tell the difference between a
main idea and a minor idea. In the above fable, the idea that the lion was
caught in a net is essential to the story, and is therefore, a main idea. But it is
not necessary or essential to know that when the lion was caught, or that he
had been ranging the forest for his prey.
Here is a one sentence summary of the fable:
A mouse, whose life had once been spared by a lion, later returned the
kindness by freeing the lion from a hunter’s net.
