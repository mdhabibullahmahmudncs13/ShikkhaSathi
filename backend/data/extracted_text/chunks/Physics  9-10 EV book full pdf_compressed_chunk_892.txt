========================================

is to be a bar magnet, and keep it in another magnetic field, then we can analyze
what kind of attractive or repulsive force it feels and also the direction of motion
due to it. In Figure 12.10, an electromagnet of this type is placed in another
magnetic field, and how it changes its position due to the repulsive force is
shown. If the electromagnet is allowed to rotate about an axis, passing through
its center, then it will try to go to a position like in the next figure.
