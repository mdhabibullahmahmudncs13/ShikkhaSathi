========================================

one of its diagonals. It is to be proved that Z4+ ZB+

ZC +£D =4 right angles.

Construction: Join 4 and C. The diagonal AC divides the, B

quadrilateral into two triangles AABC and AADC.
Proof:
(1) In A4BC [The sum of three angles of a
ZBAC + ZACB + ZB = 2 right angles. triangle is 2 right angles]
(2) Similarly, in ADAC [sum of three angles of a
ZDAC + ZACD + 2D = 2 right angles. triangle is 2 right angles]
(3) Therefore, ZDAC + ZACD + ZD + [ From (1) and (2) ]
ZBAC + ZACB + ZB =(2+2) right angles.
(4) £ZDAC + £BAC = ZA and ZACD + ZACB = ZC | [The sum of adjacent angles]
Therefore, ZA+ B+ C+ 2D= 4 right angles. | [The sum of adjacent angles]
(Proved) [ from (3) ] 8
