the object XY. Light coming from point Y reflects from point P of the concave
mirror and again goes through point Y towards point O. So it can be
comprehended that it will stay on a point of line OP or on an extended part of
line OP. To determine this exact point another ray has to be drawn from point Y
towards the concave mirror, but we are not doing that. If we can determine the
image of the point X as before we can find the exact location of the image of
point Y. To determine the image of point X, two lines have to be drawn from this
point. The first line will be an extended part of the line OX. It will touch the
