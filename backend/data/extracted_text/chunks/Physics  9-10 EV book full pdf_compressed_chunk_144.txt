========================================

s=uvt
If there is uniform acceleration, the final velocity is:
v=u+at

This equation shows that the velocity is changing with time. The entire
duration is divided into many tiny equal intervals, the distance covered in each
small interval will not be the same. This is because the particle's velocity chang-
es constantly due to acceleration. However, to calculate the total distance trav-
eled, these varying distances must be summed. Calculus, a specialized branch of
mathematics, is used to perform such calculations. However, if the particle's
acceleration is uniform, it is possible to determine the total distance traveled .
