Example 26. In the figure, ABCD is a square whose length of each side is 22
metre and region AED is a half circle. Determine the area of the whole region.
Solution: Let the length of each side of the square ABCD be a.
.-. Area of square region = a? £
Again, AED is a half circle. YN

Therefore, area of the half circle = mr? H 0

= (222 + 7% 3.1416 x 11%) = 674.07 square metre (approx.)
The required area is 674.07 square metre (approx.)
