========================================

their velocities are changed. Now, v, and v, are the new velocities of masses mm,

and m, respectively (figure 3.04). Can we find the values of v, and v, after the

collision?

The combined momentum of the two objects before collision = mu +m,u,
The combined momentum of the two objects after collision =m v +m,v,

Since, no force is applied from outside, hence the momentum before collision
" and after collision will be the same. This is the law of conservation of
H momentum. Therefore we can write,
