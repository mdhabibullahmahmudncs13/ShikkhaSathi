========================================

Bangladesh has a huge population, and that is why the class size is usually big.

The schools in our countiy lack skilled teachers. teaching and learning materials,

science laboratories, etc. The students do not have a wide scope of doing

scientific experiments. E-learning can play a vital role to solve these problems.

A lesson conducted by a skilled teacher may be recorded and distributed to

hundreds of schools. Different learning materials for teaching a specific subject

can be given lo students. Teachers themselves may make their lessons more
effective and these lessons may be reused in other classes. Many terchers of

Bangladesh are using e-learning materials.
