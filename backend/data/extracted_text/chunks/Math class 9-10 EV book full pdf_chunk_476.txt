Trigonometric ratios of the angles 0° and 90°
We have learnt how to determine the trigonometric r
ratios for the acute angle 6 of aright-angled triangle. Now,
we see, if the angle is made gradually smaller, how
the trigonometric ratios change. As 6 get smaller
the length of the side, PN also gets smaller. The
point P closes to the point N and finally the angle 0 N
6 comes closer to the angle 0°, OP is reconciled with
ON approximately.

When the angle # comes closer to 0°, the length of the line segment PN reduces to
PN
zero and in this case the value of sinf = oP is approximately zero. At the same
ON
time, the length of OP is equal to the length of ON and the value of cos 0 = oP
is 1 approximately.
