========================================

Dimension of work [W] = ML2T 2
Force is a vector quantity and the distance traversed or the displacement is also a
vector quantity but in case of work the product of those two vectors is a scalar
quantity.
As individual vectors there is no such condition that the direction of force and
distance travelled has to be same but in these book, we will only discuss the
force and distance travelled in the same direction.
Have you noticed, while discussing work, we said that the “force” has done the
work. A person or a machine may push any object to some distance by applying
a force. In terms of daily life we say that the person or the machine has done the
work. But in physics, neither the person nor the machine does the work, always
