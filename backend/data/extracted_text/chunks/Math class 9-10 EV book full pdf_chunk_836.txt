Work: Draw frequency polygon from the marks obtained in Bangla by the
students of your class in first terminal examination.

Example 5. The frequency distribution table of the marks obtained by 50

students of class X in science are given. Draw the frequency polygon of the data

(without using histogram):

Class 31 —40(41 —50(51 — 60/61 — 70/71 — 80/81 — 90/91 — 100

interval

Freqweny | 6 | % | 0 | | 5 | 7 | 7
Solution: Here the given data are discrete. In this case, it is convenient to draw
frequency polygon directly by finding the mid-point of class interval.

1+ 4

The Mid-point of the first class interval (31 — 40) is 22 =35.5

Class 31 —40}41 — 50{51 — 60/61 — 7071 — 80|81 — 90|91 — 100
