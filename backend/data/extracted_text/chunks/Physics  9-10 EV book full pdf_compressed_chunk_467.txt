========================================

the "heat energy". Because what we mean by heat energy is actually nothing but
the combined kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance. When the
molecules of a solid are heated then the molecules vibrate about their fixed
positions. The more the molecules are heated, the more the vibration increases.
If the molecules are heated enough the molecules become free by overcoming
the intermolecular forces among them. Then we call it a liquid. Then the
molecules move randomly among themselves. Since the molecules are in
motion, they have kinetic energy. The more the molecules are heated, the faster
they will move. If the molecules are heated more, they may be completely free
from their intermolecular forces. Then we call it a gas. The more a gas will be
