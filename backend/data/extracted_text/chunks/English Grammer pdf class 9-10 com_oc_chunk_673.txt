Sample Question 311

+ Avoid redundant words and phrases in the stem. Extrancous details make a
question more complex and less reliable.

+ Include any language in the stem that you would have to repeat in each answer
option.

* Options should be similar in length and structure.

* The number of answer options should not be more than four.

+ Distracters must be incorrect, but plausible. Try to include among the
distracters options that contain common errors.

* To make distracters more plausible, use words that is familiar to students.

+ If a recognizable key word appears in the correct answer, it should appear in
some or all of the distracters as well. Don't let a verbal clue decrease the validity
of your exam.
