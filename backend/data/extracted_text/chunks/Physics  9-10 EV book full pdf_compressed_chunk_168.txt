========================================

Let the marble or pencil or pen move on the inclined plane and start
counting one, two, three and so on. Up to which number could you count
for the the marble, pencil or pen to reach the lower end of the inclined
plane. Calculate the actual time by multiplying with the approximate
multiple.
5. Repeat the experiment several times and calculate the average time.
6. Calculate the speed, dividing the length of inclined plane by the average
time. This is average speed.
7. Increase the slope of the inclined plane by placing another book.
Measure the new height after placing the second book. Calculate the slope
for this height.
