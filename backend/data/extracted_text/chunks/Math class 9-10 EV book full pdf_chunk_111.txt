========================================

1) Given, A ={4,5,6,7} and B ={0,1,2,3}
So ANB={4,56,71n{0,1,2.3} =o
Since ANB =@
Therefore, A and B are mutually disjoint .
2) Given,
B={0,1,2,3}
oo P(B) = {0}, {1}, {2}, {3},{0,1},{0,2}, {0.3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3},
{0,1,2},{0,1,3},{0,2,3},{1,2,3},{0,1,2,3}, 2}
Here number of elements of B is 4 and number of elements of the power set
is 21 = 16
if nis the number of elements of B then number of elements of power set
is 2".
number of elements of P(B) satisfies 2" formula.
3) Given, R={(z,y):zc€ A yc Aandy=x+1} and A ={4,5,6,7}
From the conditions of R we get y =x + 1
Now, for each x € A draw a list by finding values of y = x + 1.
