solids. We have seen in case of a spring that the force by which it is pulled when
it is expanded to a certain distance, it pushes by the same force when it is
compressed by the same amount. This is not true completely for the molecules
of a solid. The amount of force by which molecules pull each other when they
are moved away to a certain distance they push themselves by much more force
when they are brought close to each other by the same distance. That is, this
spring is a special type of spring. Less force is applied to expand but more
force is applied to compress it.

Now imagine that the molecules are <r,

vibrating due to a certain temperature. 21 wl = ere "
