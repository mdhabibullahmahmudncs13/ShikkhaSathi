Area of the regular hexagon = 6x area of ACOD
=06x 4/3 square metre = 24/3 square metre
The required area in 24v/3 square metre.

Example 17. According to the given figure
1) Find length of the diagonal of the rectangle.
2) Find the integer value of its area. n /\ Dn
3) Find the perimeter of the isosceles triangle. Co]
B 50 Cc
Solution:
1) As per the given figure, the area is divided into rectangle ABCD and
isosceles triangle ADE.
Length of diagonal of rectangle ABCD = +/50% + 14? cm = 51.92 cm
(approx.)
2) Area of rectangle ABC'D = 50 x 14 square cm = 700 square cm
