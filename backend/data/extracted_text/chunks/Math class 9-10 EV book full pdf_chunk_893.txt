Appendix 387
Therefore, we are to make the denominators of the two fractions each equal to 6b7 .
x
Here, ¢ = ax3n [ 6bn + 2b =3n]
2b 2bx3n
= dan
6bn
and "= 22D Lbs 30 = 20]
3n 3nx2b
_ 2bm
6bn
3 2b
.". The fractions with common denominator are can and “om.
6bn 6bn
Rules for expressing the fractions with common denominator
e Find the L.C.M. of the denominators of the fractions.
o Divide the L.C.M. by the denominators of each fraction to find the quotient.
e Multiply the numerator and denominator of the respective fraction by the
quotient thus obtained.
Example 4. Express the fractions with common denominator : a , bo
