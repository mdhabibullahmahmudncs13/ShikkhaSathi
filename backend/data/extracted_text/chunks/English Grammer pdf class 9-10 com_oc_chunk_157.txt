78 English Grammar and Composition
Grammar point
Can and could are modal verbs, and are used like auxiliaries before the main
verb.
We make the negative by adding not/n’t to can/could. Note how we write
cannot. There is no break between can and not:
| cannot fly like a bird.
To make questions we say can /could + name/pronoun + main verb:
Can/could you pass me the salt, please? Can you use a
computer?
Use
Can/could for ability, and cannot for inability/prohibition:
We use can to express ability: | can sing and I can dance.
In the sentence But I cannot fly like a bird, cannot expresses lack of ability.
The past tense of can as ability is could: Two years ago | could walk for miles,
but now | cannot.
We use cannot/can’t to express prohibition: You cannot bring mobile phones
