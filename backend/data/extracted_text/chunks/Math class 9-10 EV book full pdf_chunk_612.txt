Example 13. 8 years ago, father’s age was eight times the age of his son. After
10 years, father’s age will be twice the age of the son. What are their present
ages?
Solution: Let the present age of father be z years and age of son is y years.
by Ist condition, x — 8 = 8(y — 8)... (1)
and by 2nd condition, x + 10 = 2(y + 10)... (2)
From (1) we get, © —8 = 8y — 64
or, zt =8y—64+8
or, x =8y —56...(3)
From (2) we get, x + 10 = 2y + 20
or, 8y — 56 + 10 = 2y + 20 [Putting the value of x from (3)]
or, 8y — 2y = 20 + 56 — 10
or, 6y = 66
or,y = 11
(3) we get, x = 8 x 11 — 56 = 88 — 56 = 32
.. at present, Father's age is 32 years and son's age is 11 years.
