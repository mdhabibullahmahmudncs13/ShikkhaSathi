1 sec? A — sec’ A
22. If tan A = —, find the value of COSC LZ SCC
V3 cosec?A + sec?A
4
23. If cosec A — cot A = 3 what is the value of cosec A 4 cot, A?
b sin A — beos A
24. If cot A= 2 find the value of asin A — boos A
a asin A + bcos A
25. If cosec A — cot A = L
xT
1) find the value of cosec A + cot A.
wr +1
2) Show that, sec A = oT
3) According to the stimulus prove that, tan A + cot A = sec A - cosec A
Trigonometric ratios for the angles 30°, 45°, and 60°.
We have learnt how to draw angles 30°, 45° and 60° in geometric way.
Exact values of these trigonometric ratios for all these angles can also be
determined geometrically.
Trigonometric ratios of the angles 30° and 60° :
Let, /ZXOZ = 30° and P is a point on OZ. Let ,
