10.78423 = 10.78423423. Desired similar repeating decimal fractions are
respectively 5.66666666, 7.34545454 and 10.78423423.
Example 9. Convert 1.7643, 3.24 and 2.78346 into similar repeating decimal
fractions.
Solution: In 1.7643 we have 4 digits in the nonrepeating part and it does not
have repeating part. In 3.24 number of digits in nonrepeating part is 0 and that
of repeating part is 2; in 2.78346 number of digits in nonrepeating part is 2 and
that in repeating part is 3. Here the largest number of nonrepeating digits is 4
and numbers of digits in the repeating parts are 2 and 3, LCM of which is 6. So
each number must have 4 nonrep 2 ating digits and 6 repeating digits.
