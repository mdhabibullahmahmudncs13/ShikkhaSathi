========================================

From the very beginning of 19th century scientists felt that many things
could not be explained with the help of existing physics. Dalton introduced
atomic theory in 1803, Thomson invented an electron within the atom, In 1911
Rutherford showed that at the center of the atom, there is the smallest nucleus and
there are positive charges in it. But it was found that the revolving electron
model around the nucleus could not be explained because, according to
electromagnetic theory, an electron should radiate its energy and fall into the
nucleus, but practically it never happens. In 1900, Max Planck introduced
quantum theory, which made it possible to explain black body radiation. Later, scientist
§ Niels Bohr used quantum theory to explain the stability of the atom. In 1924, scientist
