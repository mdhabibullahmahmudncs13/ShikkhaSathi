Work: Make two groups with all the students of your class. (a) Make
a frequency distribution table of the time taken by each of you to solve a
problem, (b) find the median from the table.
Mode:
In class VIII, we have learned that the number which appears maximum times in
a data is the mode of the data. In a data, there may be one or more than one
mode. If there is no repetition of a member in a data, data will have no mode.
Now we shall discuss how to determine the mode of classified data using formula.
Determining Mode of Classified Data: Mode = L + rh Le xh, where
hit Jz

L is the lower limit of mode-class i.e. the class where the mode lies,

fi = frequency of mode-class — frequency of the class previous
