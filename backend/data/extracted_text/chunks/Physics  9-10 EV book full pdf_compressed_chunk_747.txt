10.3.1 Electroscope

An electroscope is a wonderful equipment for test of static electricity. The

equipment is very simple. To determine

the presence of charge, it contains two

light leaves of gold, aluminum or some

other metal. These two leaves are connect-

ed to a metal disc by a highly conducting i

rod. The whole setup is kept inside a glass [wy = | == ==__-- J

bottle with a nonconducting stopper so ty a 1

that it can be seen from outside, but air or NY

anything else cannot touch the light metal Af

leaves. ga | :

If a glass rod is rubbed by silk, positive of charge comes down to ground

charge is accumulated in the rod. Now if from clouds, we call it lightning.
