========================================

what is the change of momentum?

Answer: when the ball is thrown, then the momentum is p = mv. After striking

the wall, when the ball bounces back, its momentum becomes p’ = -mv.

Therefore the change of momentum:

p-p' =mv-(-mv) =2mv

For this change of momentum, the wall exerts a force on the tennis ball for a

very short time. In cricket, the batsman hits the ball by the bat for a very short

interval of time and the change of its momentum occurs. We call these six’s or a

boundary.

3.5 Collision

3.5.1 Conservation of Momentum and Energy

Let us consider that two objects of masses m, and m, are moving along a straight

line on a plane. Due to the difference of their velocities they collide and hence

their velocities are changed. Now, v, and v, are the new velocities of masses mm,
