The unit of conductivity 6 is: (Q m)~!
We have to remember one thing; the resistance of a substance is the hindrance
to electron flow.
The more the atoms and molecules vibrate the more the barrier the electrons will
face while going through them. In other words, the more the resistance. As the
vibrations of the atoms and molecules increases with the increase in
temperature, so the specific resistance of a conducting substance also increases
with temperature. So the temperature has to be specifically mentioned while
expressing resistance or specific resistance of a substance.
Fixed Resistance: Resistors with a definite value are used in different circuits.
They can be of different shapes and of different types. The resistances that are
