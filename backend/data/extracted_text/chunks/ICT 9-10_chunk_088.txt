========================================

Installation of software, except the operating system one, depends almost on the
operating system itsell. However, the process of installation is almost the same.
We need the soft or the digital copy of the piece of software to install it. It can.
be installed from CD. DVD, pendrive, or the Internet. In most of the cases, a
programme called ‘Auto Run” is attached with the software. When you insert a
CD and DVD or connect a pendrive to the USB port, the ‘Auto run’ programme
becomes activated and the piece of software seeks permission to set up. Follow
the next steps aller giving the permission and the piece of software will be
installed in your computer. After restarting the device, you will be able to use the
programme.
