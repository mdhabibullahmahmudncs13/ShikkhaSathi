Current Electricity 305
If the unit of charge is the Coulomb (C) and of time is second (t), then the unit
of electric current is ampere A. Interesting thing is, to find the unit of charge we
said, if one ampere electric current flows for one second then the amount of
charge that flows is called 1 Coulomb. Electric current is the rate of flow of
charge; if 1 ampere current flows from A to B, it means 1 coulomb positive
charge has been moved from A to B. Which actually means that the amount of
electrons equivalent to 1 Coulomb charge has been moved from B to A.
Therefore, you see that the direction of electric current is opposite to the
direction of flow of electrons. (All problems could have been solved if we
