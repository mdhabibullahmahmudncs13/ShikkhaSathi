Geometric Series
If the ratio of any term and its antecedent term of any series is always equal i.e.,
if any term divided by its antecedent term, the quotient is always equal, the series
is called a geometric series and the quotient is called common ratio. Such as, of
the series 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 the first term is 2, the second term is 4, the third
term is 8, the fourth term is 16 and the fifth term is 32. Here,

. . 4
the ratio of the second term to the first term = 5= 2
