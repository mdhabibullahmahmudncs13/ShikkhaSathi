The light of a candle is an example. We see the transformation of chemical
energy into mechanical energy using gas, patrol, diesel or such type of fuels in
different kinds of engines. If we observe closely, we will find that at first
chemical energy is converted into heat energy and then heat energy is converted
into mechanical energy. But in the era of modern technology, the greatest
example of conversion of chemical energy is the battery, where chemical energy
is converted into electrical energy. We cannot find any space where chemical
energy is not converted into electrical energy using battery starting from mobile
phone to car or from clock to space shuttle. The amazing example of chemical
energy is our body or body of living beings, where chemical energy from food is
