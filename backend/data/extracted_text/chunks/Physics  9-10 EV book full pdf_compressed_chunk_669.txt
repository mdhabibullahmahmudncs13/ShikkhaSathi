========================================

c 299% 10° ms?
nT 22x 10h met

i.e. the velocity of light in a vacuum is 1.33 times greater than the velocity of
light in water .
The refractive index of the glass fiber in a Table 9.01: Refractive index

. . of some substance
fiber optic cable is 1.5.
Therefore, the velocity of light in the fiber is
v=3x10°ms?/1.50 = 2.00 x 10% ms™
Refractive index is a number and it has no
unit. As the maximum velocity of light is c¢,
the value of »n always greater than 1 . In
Table 9.01 the refractive index of some substances are given.
Naturally, the refractive index of a vacuum will be 1.
The refractive index of air is 1.00029 which is so close to 1that we will take it as
1 during calculations.
