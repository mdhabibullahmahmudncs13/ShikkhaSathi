Let ABCD be a quadrilateral region and Za be a definite angle. It is required
to construct a parallelogram with angle Zz and the area equal to area of the
quadrilateral region ABCD.
Drawing: Join B, D. Through C, draw C'F parallel to DB which intersects
the side AB extended at F. Find the midpoint G of the line segment AF. At A
of the line segment AG, draw GAK equal to Zz and draw AK || GH through G.
