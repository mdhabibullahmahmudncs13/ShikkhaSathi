12 Physics
physics, both theoretical and experimental research have been conducted. The
main objectives of physics is to find out the laws of nature by carrying out
research in these two different fields.
1.4.3 Development of Technology Using the Laws of Nature
From the theory of relativity Einstein deduced the law £ = mc? and showed that
mass can be converted into energy. In 1938, by breaking a nucleus Otto Hann
and Fritz Strassmann showed that the amount of mass reduced, is converted to
energy.
Using this formula the nuclear bomb was made and dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki in the Second World War and millions of people were killed within a
second. Not only deadly weapons can be made but also it is possible to use for
