Chapter 5. Equations in One Variable 103

Usage of linear equations

In real life we have to solve different types of problems. In most cases of solving

these problems mathematical knowledge, skill and logic are necessary. In real

cases, in the application of mathematical knowledge and skill, as on one side the

problems are solved smoothly, on the other side in daily life, solutions of the

problems are obtained by mathematics. As a result, the students are interested in

mathematics. Here different types of problems based on real life will be expressed

by equations and they will be solved.

For determining the unknown quantity in solving the problems based on real life,

variable is assumed instead of the unknown quantity and then equation is formed
