========================================

from their intermolecular forces. Then we call it a gas. The more a gas will be
heated, the faster its molecules will move. The more the velocity, the more the
kinetic energy.
Since we cannot see the molecules with our naked eyes, we cannot see their
movement, so we try to understand the whole thing indirectly, we call it heat
energy and try to explain the states of matter considering it as temperature. So
we can say that the energy which is obtained due to molecular vibration or
motion of a substance is called heat. As it is a form of energy like other energy,
so its unit is Joule (J). There is another unit of heat which is calorie (cal). The
amount of heat energy required to increase the temperature of 1 gm of water by
