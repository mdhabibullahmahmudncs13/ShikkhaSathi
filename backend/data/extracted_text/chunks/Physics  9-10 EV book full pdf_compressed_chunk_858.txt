========================================

(a) Electrically insulated cover: Open wire carrying electricity is dangerous,
so it is always covered with plastic or another insulator. If short circuit occurs for
any reason i.e. positive and negative wires touches without any resistance then,
according to Ohm’s law, a large amount of current flows, the wire become
heated, the plastic burns and can even cause fire. So it should be taken care that
insulating layer remains unaltered and intact.

(b) Better Connection: The electrical connections should be made correctly
where electrical equipment run using huge amount of electricity. If the
connections are not properly done, extra resistance is produced and according to
FR, it may be heated, may burn the insulating layer, and can damage the
electrical connection.
