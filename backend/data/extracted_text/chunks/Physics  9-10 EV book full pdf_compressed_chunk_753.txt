========================================

Charge of electron : —1.6 x 107° C

Charge of proton : +1.6 x 107° C
You can see, if ¢, and g, both are positive or negative, then the value of I is
positive and they will repel one another. If one charge is positive and the other is
negative, then the value of F will be negative, which means the direction of the
force is changed, that is, the charges will attract one another. We have seen this
earlier and now the formula shows this too.

Example
Question: A +1 C charge and a -1 C charge are placed at a distance of 10 cm.
How much force is acting between them?
Answer: Two opposite charges will attract each other. The force acting between
them: (Figure 10.10 a)

F=k fz
