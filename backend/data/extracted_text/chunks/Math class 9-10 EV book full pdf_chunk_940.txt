Example 5. Solve the equations
Sx—4y=6
x+2y=4
Solution : The given equations are
Sx—4y =6.cccccce(l)
X+2y=4.(2)
Here, multiplying equation (1) by 1 and equation (2) by 2, we get
Sx—4y=6.........(3)
2x+4y=8.cce(4)
Adding (3) and (4) we get,
Tx =14

of, X=—verreeren(4
~ “4
Lx=2
Putting the value of X in equation (2), we get
2+2y=4
or, 2y=4-2
or y=2

soy=1
.. Required solution is (x, y) = (2,1) .
Example 6. Solve the equations
x+4y=14
Tx=3y=5
Solution : The given equations are
x+4y=14.()
