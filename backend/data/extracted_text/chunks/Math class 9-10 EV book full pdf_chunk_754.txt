========================================

4. Area of Rhombus Region: Two diagonals of
a rhombus region are given. Let the diagonals be
AC = dy, BD = dj of the rhombus ABCD and the
diagonals intersect each other at O. D c
Diagonal AC' divides the rhombus region into two a
equal triangular regions. We know that the diagonals )
of a thombus bisect each other at right angles. Ltn
.. Height of AACD = % : ?

s = 2x area of AACD = 2 x ody - 5 = duds
