========================================

create electricity from electric cells by using chemical energy. We generate
electric energy too from the nuclear energy we get by dividing a heavy nucleus
or by addition of light nucleuses. Energy is developed in our body taking
nutrition from food, we perform our activities.
The history of our civilization itself is the history of utilization of energy by
generating energy. We see different forms of such energy around us, for example-
mechanical energy, heat energy, sound energy, light energy, magnetic energy,
electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy and solar energy.
The most general form of energy is the mechanical energy, the energy that is
obtained due to position, shape and motion of the object is called mechanical
