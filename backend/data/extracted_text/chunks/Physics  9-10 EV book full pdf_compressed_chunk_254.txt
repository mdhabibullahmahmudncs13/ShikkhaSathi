========================================

mM
F=Gry
Already we have seen that this force can be expresed as mg.
From Newton’s third law we know that the
mass m also attracts the giant earth towards
itself. That force is also F, but in the
opposite direction. We do not bother about
V this force, the reason is that the acceleration
= a of the earth due to this force can be
Ly determined:
Pra F=Ma
5 p= Here, M is the mass of the earth and a is the
f BRAS = E acceleration,
p< 5
(SEL Therefore, 4 = EF _mg_ () g
hr M M M
\ If the mass of the earth is M= 5.98 x 10* kg,
then if an object of mass 1 kg is released

Figure 3.12: As the carth attracts a from above then the acceleration of the
mass, the mass also attracts the earth will be,
earth in the same manner a=1.6x10"%*m/s?
