spring balance with you, you can measure the mass more accurately and you
can measure the weight from there.
Serial [Name of Mass of object obtained | Mass of object in kg Weight of the object
i from bal. i 5 -
Number the object from bal eo gram, mn = m/1000 kg W=mg N
3.8 Newton’s Third Law
We have learnt from Newton’s first law what happens when no force is applied.
‘We have learnt from Newton's second law what happens when a force is applied.
‘We will learn from Newton's third law what type of reaction takes place between
the two objects when an object applies force on another object.
Newton’s Third Law: When an object applies a force on another object,
then that object also applies a force of equal magnitude on the first object
