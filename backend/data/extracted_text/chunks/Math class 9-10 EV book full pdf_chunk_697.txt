2) Prove that, BD: DC' = BA: AC
3) If a line segment parallel to BC intersect AB and AC at P and Q
respectively, prove that BD : DC' = BP : CQ.
13. In the figure, ABC and DEF are two similar triangles.
1) Name the matching sides and A D
matching angles of the triangles. NN aN
2) Prove that,
AABC AB? Ac? per BM CE NF
ADEF DE? DF? EF?
BC 3
3) If BC =3cm, EF =8cm, ZB =060°, ap = 3 “nd area of AABC
is 3 square ¢ m, then draw the triangle ADEF and find its area.
