========================================

Repeated decimal fractions: In any repeating decimal fraction all or some
digits on the right of decimal point come again and again. For example,
3.333... 2.454545. .., 5.12765765. .. etc are repeated decimal fractions.
Infinite decimal fractions: In an infinite decimal fraction digits on the right
of decimal point never terminate, i.e. the number of digits on the right of the
decimal point will not be finite neither will its part appear repeatedly. For
example, 1.4142135..., 2.8284271... etc are Infinite decimal fractions.
Remarks: Finite and repeating decimal fractions are rational numbers whereas
infinite decimal numbers are irrational numbers. Value of any irrational number
can be determined up to any desired decimal place. If numerator and denominator of
