‘Work:
1) Make frequency distribution table of the heights (in cm.) of 49 students
of your class and find the mean without using any formula.
2) From the above problem, deduct the heights of 9 students and then find
the median of heights (in cm.) of 40 students.
Determining Median of Classified Data: If the number of classified data is
n .
n, the value of th term of classified data is median. And the formula used to
n n h
determine the median or the value of Sth term is : Median = L+ (5 — F) x =
where L is the lower limit of the median class, n is the frequency, F, is the
