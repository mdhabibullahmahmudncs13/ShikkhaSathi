Chapter 3
Algebraic Expressions
[Prior knowledge of this chapter are attached to the Appendix at the end of this
book. At first the Appendix should be read / discussed. ]
Algebraic formulae are used to solve many algebraic problems. Moreover, many
algebraic expressions are presented by resolving them into factors. That is why the
problem solved by algebraic formulae and the contents of resolving expressions into
factors by making suitable for the students have been presented in this chapter.
Moreover, different types of mathematical problems can be solved by resolving
into factors with the help of algebraic formulae. In the previous class, algebraic
formulae and their related corollaries have been discussed elaborately. In this
