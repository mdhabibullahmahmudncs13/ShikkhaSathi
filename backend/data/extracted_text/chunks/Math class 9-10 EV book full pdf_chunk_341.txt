Chapter 6. Lines, Angles and Triangles 141
or, ZACD + ZACB + ZBCD = 2 right angles
or, ZBCD + ZBCD = 2 right angles
or, 2/BCD = 2 right angles.
». ZBCD = 1 right angle
Example 2. PQR is a triangle. PA, QB and RC are three medians which
intersect at point O.
1) Draw a figure based on the information.
2) Prove that, PQ + PR > QO + RO
3) Prove that, PA+ QB + RC < PQ + QR + PR
Solution:
1)
P
Q A Rr
2) From figure 1) it is to be proved that, PQ + PR > QO + RO
Proof: Any two sides of a triangle are greater than the third one.
In triangle APQB, PQ + PB > QB
Again in triangle ABOR, BR + BO > RO
.PQ+ PB+ BR+ BO > QB + RO
or, PQ + PR + BO > QO + OB + RO
PQ + PR > QO + RO
