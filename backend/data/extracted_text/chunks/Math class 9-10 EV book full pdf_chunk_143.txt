========================================

The algebraic expressions may consist of one or more terms. So, the factors may
also contain one or more terms. Some process of resolving expressions into factors
will be discussed here.
Common Factor: If any polynomial expression has common factor in every
term, at first they are to be found out. For example,
Example 18.  3a%b + Gab? + 12a°b* = 3ab(a + 2b + dab)
Example 19. 2ab(z —y) + 2bc(z — y) + 3ca(z —y) = (x — y)(2ab + 2bc + 3ca)
Perfect Square: An expression can be expressed in the form of a perfect
square.
Example 20. Resolve into factors: dr? +122 +9
Solution: 42? + 122 + 9 = (22)% +2 x 2x x 3 + (3)?
= (22 +3)? = (2x + 3)(2z +3)
