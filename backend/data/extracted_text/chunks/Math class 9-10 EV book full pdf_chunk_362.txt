========================================

LCA=CE
Therefore, AABC, AB + BC + CA=DB+ BC+ CE =DE =p
ZABC = ZADB + /DAB = x + 1 = Zr
1 1
and ZACB = ZAEC + Z/EAC = 54Y + 54 =Zy
Therefore, AABC is the required triangle.
‘Work:
Two acute base adjacent angles and the perimeter of a triangle are given.
Construct the triangle in an alternative way.
0 Example 1. Construct a triangle ABC, in which ZB = 60°, ZC" = 45° and
5 perimeter AB + BC' + CA = 11 cm.
