========================================

will be able to understand that the ~~ i =
speed of the stone is not changing but". . i =

the velocity is changing at every Bh TC —

instant! Because at every instant the EP

direction of motion of the stone is (5 E,

changing. If the stone moves along a YC

straight line, then the direction of its Age $05)

motion will not change. Since it is hE

revolving, its direction of motion is en

changing continuously. So it is an Figure 2.05 : Incase of rotation of a
example of uniform speed- not of stone tied with string, velocity might be
uniform velocity. If it is uniform changed though speed is same.
velocity, then it must be uniform

speed. Whereas for uniform speed it is not guaranteed that the velocity will be
uniform.
