The Passive 189
2, Each piece is folded again across the middle and torn to make a
total of four equal-size pieces.
Now one of the pieces is placed on the table with the long sides pointing
down. A horizontal line is drawn across the top of the paper about a quarter of
the way from the top. Then two vertical lines are drawn downwards from the
horizontal line, so that the bottom part of the paper is divided into three
equal-size parts.
Next, the paper has to be torn along each of these vertical lines as far as the
horizontal line sothat three flaps are created. Then the left flap is folded
toward you and the right flap is folded away from you — the folds are made
right at the top of the flap. The centre flap should not be folded, though.
