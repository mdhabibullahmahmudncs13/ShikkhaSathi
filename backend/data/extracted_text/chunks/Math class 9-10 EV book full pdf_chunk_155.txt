co fla)=0
Hence, any polynomial f(z) will be divisible by (x — a) if and only if f(a) = 0.
This formula is known as factor theorem.
Proposition 12. If degree of f(z) is positive and a # 0, then if f(z) is divided
by (ax +b), the remainder will be f (-2).
Proof: Degree of divisor ax +b, (a #0) is 1.
Hence, we can write: f(z) = (az +b) h(z) +r =a (x + B) ch(z) +r
b
sfx) = (a+ . ca h(z) +r
It is clear that, if f(x) is divided by (x + 2). the quotient will be a - h(x) and
the remainder will be 7.
Here, divisor = 2 — (+9)

Hence, according to remainder theorem r = f 4

Therefore, if f(x) is divided by (az + b), the remainder will be { —— |) .
