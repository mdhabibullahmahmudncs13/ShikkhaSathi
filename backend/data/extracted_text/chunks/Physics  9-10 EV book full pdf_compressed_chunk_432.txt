amount of vapor inside it increases. Vapor is water, in a molecule of water there
is an oxygen and two hydrogen atom and molecular mass of water is
(16+1+1=) 18. The main element of air is nitrogen (atomic mass 14), being
created by two atoms it’s molecular mass is (14+14=) 28 and oxygen (molecu-
lar weight 16), is also created by two atoms, so, it’s molecular mass is (16+16=)
32, which is much more than the molecular mass of water. So, when there is
vapor in the air, water of less molecular mass takes the place of nitrogen and
oxygen of higher molecular mass and so the density of air decreases. If the
density of air decreases, the air pressure also decreases. So, it is possible to
