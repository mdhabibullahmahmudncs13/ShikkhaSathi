========================================

cold drinks with a 10.5 meter long straw. (This is not realistic at all. But
acknowledge it for the sake of argument!) Then you would discover that the
drinks rise 10.3 meter and stop suddenly. No matter how much you try the drinks
do not rise any more. (We are assuming that the density of cold drinks is close to
the density of water!)
Mercury is not a liquid to take into mouth but for the sake of argument imagine
you try to sip it to get it in your mouth with a straw. If the straw is longer than 76
cm, you will discover that the mercury has stopped just after rising 76 cm.
You try to sip the mercury does not rise any more! Density of mercury is 13.6
times more than the density of water, so elevated levels of more but the mercury
is 13.6 times lesser than the water.
