Proof:

For AAPQ and ADEF, AP = DE, AQ = DF and internal ZA = internal 2D

o AAPQ = ADEF [SAS theorem]

SLA=/D, LAPQ = /E, ZAQP = /F

AB AC AB AC

Again, since DE DF therefore ar a0 [theorem 29]

-. PQ || BC

Therefore ZABC = ZAPQ and ZACB = ZAQP

co LA=4D, LB =/E, and LC = LF

i.e. AABC and ADEF are equiangular.

Therefore AABC and ADEF are similar.

Theorem 35. The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is equal to the

ratio of squares on any two matching sides.

Special Nomination: Let the triangles ABC and DEF be similar and BC' and

EF be their matching sides respectively. It is required to prove that, AABC :

ADEF = BC*: EF?

A
/I
B G Cc E H F

Drawing: Draw perpendiculars AG and DH on BC and EF respectively. Let
