========================================

11-20 [21-30 [31-40 [ 41 — 50
Solution: The maximum numbers of Class Frequency frequency are 25 which lie
in the class (41 — 50). So it is obvious that this class is the class of mode. We
know that, Mode = L + ho xh
fit fa
Here, L=41, fy =25-20=05, f, =25—0=25, h = 10 [If the frequency is maximum pS
in the last class, the frequency of following class is zero] S
