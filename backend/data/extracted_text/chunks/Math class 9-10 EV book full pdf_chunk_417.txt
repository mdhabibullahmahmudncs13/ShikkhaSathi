Secant and Tangent of the circle
Consider the relative position of a circle and a straight line in the plane. Three
possible situations of the following given figures may arise in such a case:
1) The circle and the straight line have no common points
2) The straight line has cut the circle at two points
3) The straight line has touched the circle at a point.

A circle and a straight line in a plane may at best have two points of intersection.
If a circle and a straight line in a plane have two points of intersection, the straight
line is called a secant to the circle and if the point of intersection is one and only
one, the straight line is called a tangent to the circle. In the latter case, the
