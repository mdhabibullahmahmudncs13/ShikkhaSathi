========================================

To measure a length, we have to look at the vernier scale after measuring up to
the last millimeter mark. The mark of the vernier scale that coincides exactly
with any millimeter mark of the main scale is then found, and then that number
is multiplied by the vernier constant. We will get the actual length by adding this
amount with the length measured by the main scale. According to our procedure
the length shown on the last scale of Figure 1.06 is 1.03 cm or 0.013 m. This
instrument consisting of a 'main scale’ and a 'vernier scale’ is called a Slide — &
calipers or vernier calipers a
