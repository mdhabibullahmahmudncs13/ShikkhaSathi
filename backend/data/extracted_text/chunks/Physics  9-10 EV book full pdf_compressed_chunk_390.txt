We can see it in another way. An atom has neutron-proton in its nucleus,
electrons remain outside. Mass of an electron is 1800 times less than the mass of
neutron-proton. Therefore mass of an atom is really the mass of its nucleus. It
does not matter too much electrons are not considered. But the things we see
around us, their shapes are not the volume of the nucleuses. Volume of the
substances come from the volume of their atoms. Electrons revolve around the
very tiny nucleus comparatively in a bigger orbit. Radius of an atom is nearly
1,00,000 times bigger than that of a nucleus.
Therefore, we can say in another way, if we can gather all the people of this world
