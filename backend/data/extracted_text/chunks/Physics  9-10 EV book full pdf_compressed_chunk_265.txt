========================================

or the grooves of the two surfaces in
contact catch onto one another. The
motion is obstructed due to this and we say frictional force is developed in the
opposite direction. If the two surfaces are pressed more, then the scratched
surfaces make better contact with one another, the grooves of one surface will
penetrate into the other’s grooves more deeply and as a result the frictional force
will be increased.
Due to friction heat is generated. It is a problem in most cases. When a piston in
a cylinder moves back and forth in a car, due to friction heat is generated there
and to control this heat, the engine of the car needs to be cooled.
3.9.1 Types of Friction
Friction is divided into three types. These are, static friction, kinetic friction,
and rolling friction.
