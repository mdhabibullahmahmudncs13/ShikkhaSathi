would be the same as the object. These three different cases can be written precisely
when the object is outside the focal distances. If any object is placed outside the focal
length, the images will be as follows:

(a) The position of the image depends on the position of the object. When the
object is placed within the focal point and at concave mirror's center, the
image will be formed outside the center. As the object is placed outside the
center of curvature of the concave mirror, the image be formed inside the
center. If the object is placed at the center, the image will also form at the
center.

(b) The image is real. So, as we can say that if the image itself is the object, the
object becomes the image.

(c) The image is inverted.
