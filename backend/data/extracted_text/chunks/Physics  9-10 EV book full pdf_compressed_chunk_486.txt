========================================

difficult to understand the cause of heat and temperature if we explain them with

the help of an atomic model. We can imagine a solid as a collection of many

molecules. We can compare the molecular forces among them with a spring. We

have imagined a spring among molecules to show how molecules are arranged

in a solid as shown in figure 6.03. When the solid is heated, its molecules will
», vibrate. The higher the temperature, the more the molecules will vibrate. We
IS . . . .
& have to improve this spring model to some extent to explain the real nature of
