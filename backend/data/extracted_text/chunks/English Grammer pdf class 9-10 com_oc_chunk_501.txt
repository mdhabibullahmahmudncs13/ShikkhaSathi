========================================

Notice that the details in the above passage describe the physical
features and appearance of Francis Macomber.

B Now read the paragraph below from another story, The Capital of the
World, by the same author and see how it describes both the
appearance and some of the nature of the person being described:

i He was a well built boy with very black, rather curly hair, good teeth and
a skin that his sisters envied, and he had a ready and unpuzzled smile. He
was fast on his feet and did his work well and loved his sisters, who
seemed beautiful and sophisticated; ..... and he loved his work.
