========================================

voltage is called a voltmeter, and E | of &
the equipment used for measuring ° 0 o
current is known as ammeter. L | SF
(Actually the same equipment can 5 L me @
be used sometimes as a voltmeter @ =1
and sometimes as an ammeter by Pd ul
turning a switch.) Let us take a few -2
battery cells. If the voltage for one =
battery cell is 1.5 V, for two cells it -3
will be 2x1.5 =3V, for three cells it
will be 3x1.5 = 4.5 V. We can apply Figure 11.04: Current flow relative to
different potential differences in potential difference due to resistance
