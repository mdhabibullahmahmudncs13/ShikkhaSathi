Theorem 2
The opposite sides and angles of a parallelogram are equal.
Proposition: Let ABCD be a
parallelogram and AC and BD be its two A D
diagonals. It is required to prove that
(a) AB = CD and AD = BC
(b) £BAD =ZBCD,Z4ABC = ZADC. B C
Proof:
(1) ABI DC and AC is their transversal,
therefore, ZBAC = ZACD . [alternate angles are equal ]
(2) Again, BC|| AD and AC is their transversal,
therefore, ZACB = 2ZDAC . [alternate angles are equal
(3) Now in AABC and AADC, «BAC = ZACD,
ZACB = «DAC and AC is common.
 AABC = AADC.
Therefore, AB=CD,BC = AD and ZABC = ZADC.| [ ASA theorem ]
Similarly it can be proved that ABD = ABDC
Therefore, ZBAD = ZBCD [Proved].
