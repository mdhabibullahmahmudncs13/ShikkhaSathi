(d) Mechanical Energy

‘When electrical energy is produced bya generator, actually electrical energy

is produced by rotating a coil of wire in a magnetic field by utilizing the

mechanical energy. Heat energy is always being produced due to friction, there

mechanical energy is transforming into heat energy.

(e) Light Energy: Light is an electromagnetic wave and we can see a definite

range of the wavelengths of this wave, we call this light. Waves of wavelength

more or less than this range is present in nature and we have generated those in

different ways. For example, in a microwave oven, we convert the

electromagnetic wave into heat energy. Now-a-days using solar cell light is
