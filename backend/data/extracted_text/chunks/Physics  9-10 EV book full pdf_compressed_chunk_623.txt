8.5.1 Image in a Spherical Convex Mirror

We have already said that the outer part of a spoon acts as a spherical convex
mirror. You can see an upright and small image of yourself there. This means
that the image in a convex mirror should always be small. sg

Reflection of Light 227
To understand how an image is formed in a spherical convex mirror, we first need
to understand how light rays reflect on such a mirror. This depends on what
angle the light rays are incident on the mirror. If we know the rules of reflection
of only three special light rays, we can easily explain how an image is formed:

(i) If light rays are travelling towards the center (Figure 8.19, XN or YR ray),

they are reflected perpendicularly and go back along the line they were as
incident on.
