‘We observe, 52 x 52 = (+)
Again, 5% x 5% = 53+: = 52X53 = §
2
So (+) =5
Square (power 2) of (52) = 5 and square root (second root) of 5 = 5%
5% is written as V/5.

Again we observe, 53 Xx 53 x 53 = (5%)
Again, 5% x 55 x 55 = 5+Hits = 5% = 5
Cube (power 3) of 5% = 5 and cube root (third root) of 5 = 5%
53 is written as V/5.
In the case of n th root,
