Example 13. The ratio of angles of a triangle is 3 : 4 : 5. Express the angles
in degree.
Solution:Let the angles, according to given ratio, be 3x, 4dr and 5z. Sum of
three angles = 108°. According to the problem, 3x + 4x + 52 = 180° or,
122 = 180° or, x = 15°, Therefore, the angles are 3z = 3 x 15° = 45°
4r = 4 x 15° = 60°
