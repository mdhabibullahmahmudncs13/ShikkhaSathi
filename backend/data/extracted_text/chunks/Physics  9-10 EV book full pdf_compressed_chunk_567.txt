Therefore, using the information of the two figures, we can say
v=Af =1mx5Hz=5 m/s
Question: In figure 7.09 a wave is shown, where A, B, C, D and E is markedas
different positions. At which positions are the phases equal?
Answer: At A and C, phases are equal.
At A and B, though the amplitudes are equal their phases are opposite.
At D and E, though they are equal, phases are not equal. pe
