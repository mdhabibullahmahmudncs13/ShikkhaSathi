========================================

(£ZADC at the circumference)
that is, ZAOC' = 2/ADC [The angle subtended by an arc at the
centre is double of the angle subtended by it at the circle]
coreflex ZAOC+ ZAOC = 2(ZABC + ZADC)
But reflex ZAOC+ ZAOC = 4 right angles
:.2(LABC + ZADC') = 4 right angles
» LABC + ZADC = 2 right angles
In the same way, it can be proved that ZBAD + ZBCD = 2 right angles.
(Proved)
Corollary 6. If one side of a cyclic quadrilateral is extended, the exterior angle
formed is equal to the opposite interior angle.
Corollary 7. A parallelogram inscribed in a circle is a rectangle.
