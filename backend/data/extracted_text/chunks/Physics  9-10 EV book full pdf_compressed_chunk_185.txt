® By the end of this chapter we will be able to-

e explain the inertia of object and the qualitative concept of force by

applying Newton’s first law of motion.

* explain the nature of fundamental forces.

* explain the influence of balanced and unbalanced forces.

e analyse the influence of force on the motion of an object.

* measure the force by applying Newton's second law of motion.

o explain the action and reaction force by Newton's third law of motion.

e analyse the influence of motion and force on safe travelling.

o explain the conservation laws of momentum and collision.

o explain different types of frictions and frictional forces.

o analyse the influence of friction on the motion of an object.
