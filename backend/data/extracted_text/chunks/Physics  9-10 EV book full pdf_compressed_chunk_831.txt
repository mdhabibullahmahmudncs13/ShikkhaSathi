Now we are ready to analyse a circuit. We may think that we have understood
the circuit completely if we can find out the potential difference in any part of
the circuit and how much current is flowing through that part. There may be
many components in a circuit like battery cell, resistance, capacitor, diode,
transistor etc. But now we will analyze the circuit composed of only the battery
cell and resistance. In a circuit, resistances are connected with copper wires,
though we have seen that copper wire has a specific resistance. But in reality, the
resistance of the connecting wires is very small with respect to the resistances
we use in a circuit, so , we do not consider it at all. We will assume that the wire
