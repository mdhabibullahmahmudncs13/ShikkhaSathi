When light reflects on the objects around us and comes into our eyes, we can see
those objects. In the previous chapter we have learned about sound as a wave. In
this chapter we will learn about light as a wave. This wave is a different kind of
wave, called an electromagnetic wave.
When light is reflected on a plane mirror, it creates an image. All of us are
familiar with this image. If a curved mirror is used instead of plane mirror, it will
create a different kind of image. We will discuss different types of images in
different mirrors in this chapter.
