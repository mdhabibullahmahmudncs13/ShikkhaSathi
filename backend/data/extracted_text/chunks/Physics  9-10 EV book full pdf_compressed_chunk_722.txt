You have certainly heard people say that the power of a lens of somebody is high.
What do we mean by the word power?
The conception of power
comes from the matter of Xx
seeing big and small using a Bie. [\
lens .If we place a body in front | Ne
of two different lenses at the = INI
same distance, and the object = = ON F
. A . F voy T
looks bigger in one lens than in
another lens , then we say the U s
power of the lens is higher in x
which the object looks bigger. Ree
If you think about it you will ~ Ho
see that the smaller the focal | he SL
length of the lens, the object is i] INES
seen bigger (Figure 9.27). ® 8
Therefore the power of a lens P Tp N ET
is inversely proportional to the
focal length. If the focal length =
is fin meters then unit of power
