digit in different way.
8.243 =8.2434343434
5.24673 = 5.24673673/67
2.99669760(67
The desired result is 2.99669760|67. We have obtained the same results in both
the cases.
Example 13. Subtract 16.437 from 24.45645.
Solution: LL
24.45645 = 24.45645
16.437 =16.43743
8.01902 [if 7 is subtracted from 6, we have 1 in
hand]
—1
8.01901
The desired result is 8.01901
Note: In the following is explained why 1 is subtracted from the rightmost
digit in different way.
24.45645 = 24.45645|64
16.437 = 16.43743|74
