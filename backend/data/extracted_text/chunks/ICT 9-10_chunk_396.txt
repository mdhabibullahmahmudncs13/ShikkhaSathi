Storing or assigning data to variables

We use = symbol to store data in variables. This is called assigning value.

Suppose, we have a variable ‘age’, Now, if we want to keep the value of age 25, we will write

in the programme: value.

age=25
If we want to print this value then we have to write:
print (age)
Now if we write and run the following programme Assignment
age=25
. age = 25
print (age) rE 7
Variable — Value
55
