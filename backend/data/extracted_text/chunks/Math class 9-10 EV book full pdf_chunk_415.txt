========================================

But ZABC + ZADC = 2 right angles. [given]

CS LAEC = LADC

But this is impossible, since in ACED, exterior ZAEC' > opposite interior ZADC'
Therefore, E and D points can not be different points. So, E must coincide with
the point D.

Therefore, the points A, B,C, D are concyclic.(Proved)

Exercise 8.3

1. If the internal and external bisectors of the angles ZB and ZC of AABC
meet at P and @ respectively, prove that B, P,C,Q are concyclcic.

2. ABCD is a circle. If the bisectors of ZCAB and ZCBA meet at the point
P and the bisectors of ZDBA and ZDAB meet at (), prove that, the four
points A, Q, P, B are concyclic.

3. The chords AB and CD of a circle with centre O meet at right angles at

3 some point within the circle, prove that, ZAOD + ZBOC = 2 right angles.
