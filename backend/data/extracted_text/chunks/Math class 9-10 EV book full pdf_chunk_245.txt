2c — 17 2x —7
or, 5———— = —F—————
22 Tx +12 22 —Tr+10
Values of the fractions of two sides are equal. Again, numerators of two sides
are equal, but denominators are unequal. In this case, if only the value of the
numerators is zero, two sides will be equal.
S22 —-T=0 or, 2r =7 ora=1
.. Solution is x = 7
