Example
ial difference of
a battery cell is 1.5V. What is the Find jo Hy ay
actual potential of both terminals? hil 1 1
Negative is zero and positive is 1.5V? T T
or negative one is -1.5 V and positive -
one is zero? Ld Hi | 1
Answer: Both of them can be true. If id = fd id
it is like Figure 11.02 (a) then the
negative is zero and the positive is
1.5 V. But if it is like 11.02 (b) then
the positive is zero and the negative is
-1.5V.
Example: Make voltage 1.5V,3.0V,-1.5V,-3.0 V using two 1.5 V battery.
Answer: This is shown in Figure 11.03.
11.1.2 Conductor, Insulator and Semiconductor
Conductor: If we have understood the structure of matter properly, then we
have understood one thing clearly. In solids the atoms and molecules strongly
