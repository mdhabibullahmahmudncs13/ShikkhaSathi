‘Weighted mean: In many cases the numerical values r1,79,...,7, of

statistical data under investigation may be influenced by different reasons/
importance/ weight. In such case, the values of the data xy,x,,..., x, along
BS with their reasons/ importance/ weight wy, ws, ..., w, are considered to find the
