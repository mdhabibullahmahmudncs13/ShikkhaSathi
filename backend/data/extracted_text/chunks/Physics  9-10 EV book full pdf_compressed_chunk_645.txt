(d) The height of the image will depend upon its position. If it is formed in
between the focal point and the center of curvature, the height of the image
will be greater than the object. The nearer to the focal point, the greater it
is. If the object is outside the center of curvature, its height will be shorter
than the real object. If the object is placed at the center of curvature, the
size of the image will be the same as the object.

Characteristics of the image formed by a concave spherical mirror:
