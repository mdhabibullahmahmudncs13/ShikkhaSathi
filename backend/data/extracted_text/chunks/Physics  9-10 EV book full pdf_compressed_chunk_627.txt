The line FP intersects line OX at the point X' i.e. the image of the point X will
be formed on the point X'. The perpendicular drawn from X' to OY will intersect
line OY at Y'. Since it appears that the reflection of X is coming from point X’,
similarly it will appear that reflection of Y is coming from Y'. Hence, XY" will
be the image of XY.
We can observe that X'Y" is always smaller than XY and the further XY is from
the convex mirror, the smaller X"Y’ will get! One should know how to draw the
image of an object placed in front of a concave or convex mirror using the laws
of reflection. It is a very important procedure in physics.
It is clear that actually no light is coming from X'Y’, it just appears that the
