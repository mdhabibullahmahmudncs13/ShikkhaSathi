Motion 43
In this chapter we will discuss only the linear motion i.e. if the change in
magnitude of the velocity occurs then only acceleration will takes place.
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time. If the acceleration is
uniform i.e. it will not change with time, then we can write;
(final velocity-initial velocity)
acceleration= ——M
time
If the velocity of an object at a certain time is u and after time t the velocity
becomes v, then the acceleration a will be;
v—u
a=—
t

The dimension of acceleration: [a] = LT™2
