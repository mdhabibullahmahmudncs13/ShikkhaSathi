Proof:
Step 1. AABC = 3 x BC x hand ADEF = 3 x EF xp
1 h
NABC 5% BOX _h BC
ADEF [yr » “EF
Step 2. But in the triangles ABG and DEH, /B = /E, ZAGB = Z/ZDHE
[1 right angle]
. Z/BAG = Z/EDH
.AABC and ADEF are equiangular, so similar.
h AB BC
AS » DE EF [as AABC and ADEF are similar]
Step 3 AABC ho BC BC BC _ BC?
PS ADEF pp “EF EF “EF EF?
Internal Division of a Line Segment in definite ratio
If A and B are two different points in a plane and m and n are two natural
numbers, we acknowledge that there exists a unique point X lying between A and
Band AX: XB=m:n.
m n
A xX B
In the above figure, the line segment AB is divided at X internally in the ratio
m:nie AX: XB=m:n.
