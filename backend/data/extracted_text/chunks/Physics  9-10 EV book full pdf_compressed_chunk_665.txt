(b) Why is a metal coating given behind a mirror?
(c) Determine the position of the image of the object PQ by drawing a
figure.

along the same path?
(c) Determine the value of the angle of reflection in =f
light of the figure above?

explain with the help of diagram. h
3. A group of students found that if a stick of 2 cm length is !
placed in front of a concave mirror, an image of 3.51 p
magnification is formed on the screen in the first step. In the Figure 8.33
second step of the experiment they found an image on the
