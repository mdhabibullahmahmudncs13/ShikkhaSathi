Effect of Heat on Matter 163

6.1.1 Internal Energy

If we accept heat as energy, the next thing we need to know how heat energy is

transferred from one place to another. Generally we think that energy always

flows from higher energy to lower energy. The amount of heat energy that is

contained in a glass of water is much more than that of a small hot pin. But if we

put the hot pin into the water, a small amount of the energy of the pin will

transfer to the water of the glass. Because of this, the flow of heat energy does

not depend on the amount of heat, it depends on the temperature. If two bodies

of different temperatures come in contact with each other, always heat transfers

from the body of higher temperature to

the body of lower temperature until the
