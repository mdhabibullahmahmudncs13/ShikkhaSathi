flows, we will see that
a) The higher the potential difference the higher the current flow.
b) If potential difference is negative, the electric current also changes
direction.
If we put the result of the experiment on a graph, it will be like figure 11.04 (a):
Therefore,
TV
If we do the same experiment by using a wire of some other materials, we will get
similar results. But the slope of the straight line may be different. (Figure
11.04(b)) Now if we analyze the results of these two experiments, we will
understand that for a certain potential difference, the current that flows through
the first conductor is more than the current that flows through the second
conductor for the same potential difference. It is as if the flow of current is easier
