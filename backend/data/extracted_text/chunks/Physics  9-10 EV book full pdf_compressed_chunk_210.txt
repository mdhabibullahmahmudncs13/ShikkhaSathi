========================================

if the rope becomes completely straight then the resultant force cannot be

made zero by neutralizing the weight 7 of the book.
3.4 Momentum
Let a truck and a bicycle hit a small car with the same velocity. In this collision
which one will damage the small car more the cycle or truck? Definitely the
truck, because the truck is much heavier than the cycle. Though the
velocity of the cycle and the truck are the same, but the momentum of the truck
is much more than that of the cycle since the truck has greater mass. Simply, the
momentum is defined as the product of the mass and the velocity. If the mass of
an object is m and its velocity is V then the momentum p' can be expressed as:
