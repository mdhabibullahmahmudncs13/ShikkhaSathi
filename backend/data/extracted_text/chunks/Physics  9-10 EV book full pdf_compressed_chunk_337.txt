You definitely have observed that when a stone hits the ground, it hits by producing
sound and heat i.e. kinetic energy is transformed into sound or heat energy.
The example (Figure 4.04) of changing between potential and kinetic energy is
wonderful. A small stone is tied by a thread and hanged from a support. If we
pull it along one side then the stone goesup by a small amount from its
stationary position and hence a potential energy is developed in it. Now if we
release the stone, due to an unbalanced force on it, it starts going towards its
stationary state, thus creating a motion in it. When it reaches the mid position
exactly, it attains the maximum velocity. So it does not stop there rather moves
