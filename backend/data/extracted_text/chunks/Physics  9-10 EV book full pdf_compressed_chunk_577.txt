Question: Sound of frequency 1 kHz is produced by a tuning fork. It was
allowed to pass through air, water and iron. It was found that the velocity
of sound in air is 334 m/s, in water is 1493 m/s and in iron 5130 m/s. What
are the wavelengths in these mediums?
Answer:
Velocity of sound= Af, here Ais the wavelength, and f is the frequency.
Here frequency is 1 kHz or 1000 Hz.

7.3.1 Echo
Since sound is one type of wave, it can have reflection. If someone speaks in a
big empty building it creates a reverberating sound, which is known as ‘Echo’.
This is due to reflection. Within the building the distance is not enough to
