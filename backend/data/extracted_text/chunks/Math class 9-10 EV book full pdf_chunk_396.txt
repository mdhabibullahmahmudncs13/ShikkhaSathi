Chapter 8. Circle 167
Step 3. Now in the rig t-angled triangles AOAE and AOCF
hypotenuse OA = hypotenuse OC' [radius of same circle]
and
AE =CF [Step 2]
SL AOAE = AOCF [ RHS theorem]
OE =0F
Step 4. But OF and OF are the distances from O to the chords AB and C'D
respectively.
Therefore, the chords AB and CD are equidistant from the centre of the
circle. (Proved)
Theorem 19. Chords equidistant from the centre of a circle are equal.
Let AB and C'D be two chords of a circle with centre
0. OF and OF are the perpendiculars from O to D
the chords AB and C'D respectively. Then OF and ae
OF represent the distance from centre to the chords Ly
AB and CD respectively. It is to be proved that if pd
OE = OF, AB = CD ANB
Drawing: Join O, A and O,C'.
