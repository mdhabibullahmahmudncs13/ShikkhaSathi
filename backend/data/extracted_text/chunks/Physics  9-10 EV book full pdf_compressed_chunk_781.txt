10.8.4 Electronics

In cold countries, the amount of water vapor in air is very low and the effects of
static electricity are very high. Many types of IC (Integrated Circuit) are used
while working with electronics. Some IC’s can be damaged by even a slightest
change of voltage to their pins. That is why a touch of the hand while working
with electronics can damage a valuable IC or the circuit board. For doing work
under these circumstances, the upper part of a table is connected to the ground
with a conducting wire. Simultaneously, the hands of the person working are
connected to the ground using an electrical conducting strap.
