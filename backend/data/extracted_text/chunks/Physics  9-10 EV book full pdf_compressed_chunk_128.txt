displacement from B to A are not equal. One is negative of the other. In vector
form we can write, _ _
AB = —BA
Distance or displacement, both have the dimension of length.
[Displacement] = L (vector)
[Distance]= L (scalar)
2.5 Speed and Velocity
Roughly we know what is meant by velocity. The measurement of how fast a
body is moving is called the velocity. In physics, velocity has a definite
meaning and in addition to velocity we use another quantity named speed. If we
have understood the two terms distance and displacement properly, then we will
be able to understand two terms speed and velocity very easily.
Speed is the rate of change of distance with respect to time. Therefore, if you
have covered 100 m distance in 20 second, your speed will be;
100 m
