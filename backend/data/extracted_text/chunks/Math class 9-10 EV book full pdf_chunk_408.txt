Proof:
Step 1. The arc BCD subtends an angle ZBOD at the centre O.
Therefore, ZBOD = 2/BAD and ZBOD = 2/BED [.- The angle
subtended by an arc at the centre is double of the angle subtended on the
circle]
.2/BAD =2/BED
or, /BAD = /BED (Proved)
Theorem 22. The angle inscribed in the semi- circle is a right angle.
Let AB be a diameter of circle with centre at O and Cc
ZACB is the angle subtended by a semi-circle. It is ON
to be proved that ZACB is a right angle. A B
Drawing: Take a point D on the circle on the \°/
opposite side of AB of the circle where C' is located. D
Proof:
Step 1. The angle standing on the arc ADB
1
ZACB = 3 (straight angle in the centre ZAOB) ['.- The angle standing
