========================================

above the belt and sends it to the + Za +20 +

metallic sphere. We know, charge + (Q=27)) +

always flows from higher potential to + +

lower potential. It always happens in hy rs

the Van de Graaff generator, because 2 0 H+

inside the metallic sphere the potential metallic | H

is equal to the potential of the surface. sphere + static charge

The excess voltage that is created on + spray

the belt due to the excess charge on the none] ~ LH

belt, is always higher than the voltage belt =

of the sphere. Due to this reason, any ui

charge inside the sphere goes to the i i
=o surface of the sphere. In this process, Figure 10.17: Van de Graaff Machine

by accumulating huge amount of charge on the sphere it is possible to develop
high potential.
