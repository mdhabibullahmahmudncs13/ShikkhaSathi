the air pressure increases and if pressure decreases the height become less than

76 cm.

5.4.2 Air Pressure and Weather

Weather has a close relationship with air pressure. You have certainly heard

many times in weather news about the creation of depression in the sea, which

means air pressure has been decreased there. Then air starts to come from the

nearby areas of high pressure to the low pressure area and sometimes a spin is

created, in special situation that spin creates cyclone. You certainly know the

news of horrible cyclones in our country.

‘When you will read about heat and temperature in the next chapter, you will

know that if the temperature of air is increased, then it expands, as a result
8 density and pressure decrease. Air pressure decreases more effectively if the
