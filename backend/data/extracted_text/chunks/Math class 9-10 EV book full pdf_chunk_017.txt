‘Work: Show the position of the following numbers in the classification of
3 9 4 .
real numbers T 5, —7,V13,0, 1, 7 12, 2 1.1234, 0.323
Example 1. Find an irrational number between v/3 and 4.
Solution: Here, v/3 = 1.7320508 . ..
Suppose, a and b are two irrational numbers between v/3 and 4.
Where a=v/3 +1 and b=v/3 +2
Obviously a and b are both irrational numbers and both are between v/3 and 4.
That is, v3 <V3+1<v3+2< 4
oa and b are the two desired irrational numbers.
In fact, we can construct countless number of such irrational numbers.
