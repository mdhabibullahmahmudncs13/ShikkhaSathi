========================================

ZAOB = ZBOC =I right angle.
Similarly, it can be proved that, ZCOD = 2D0A = 1 right
angle. (Proved)
Activity
1. Prove that the diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other.
2. A worker has made a rectangular concrete slab. In how many different
ways can he be sure that the slab is really rectangular?
8.4 Area of Quadrilaterals
A quadrilateral region is divided into two triangular region by one of its
diagonals. So, the area of the quadrilateral region is equal to the sum of area of
the triangular regions. In our previous classes, we have learnt how to find areas
of square and rectangular regions. We have seen that rectangle and
wy parallelogram with same base and height have equal areas. Here, the methods of
& finding the area of rhombus and trapezium have been discussed.
