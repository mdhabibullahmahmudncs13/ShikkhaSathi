Follow the general guidelines below while writing True/False items for your students:

* Base the item on a single idea.

+ Write items that test an important idea.

* Avoid lifting statements right from the text.

+ Make the statements as brief as possible.

+ Write clearly true or clearly false statements.

* Try to avoid such words as all, ahways, never. only, nothing. and alone.

+ The use of words like more, less, important, unimportant, large, small, recent,
old, tall, great, and so on, can easily lead to ambiguity.
