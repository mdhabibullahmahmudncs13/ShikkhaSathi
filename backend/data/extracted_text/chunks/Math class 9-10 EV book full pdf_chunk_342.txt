3) Drawing: Produce PA to D such that PA = AD. Add Q, D.
Proof:
In triangle AQAD and APAR, 4
QA = AR, AD = PA
and the included ZQAD = the included c B
ZPAR = NAN
 AQAD = APAR and QD = PR LAT
Now, in APQD. PQ + QD > PD Q
or, PQ + PR > 2PA | Ais the mid point
of PD | b
Similarly, PQ + QR > 2QB  PR+ QR > 2RC
oS PQ+PR+PQ+QR+PR+QR>2PA+2QB+2RC
or, 2PQ + 2QR + 2PR > 2PA + 2QB + 2RC
or, PQ + QR + PR> PA+ QB + RC
o.PA+QB+ RC <PQ+QR+ PR
