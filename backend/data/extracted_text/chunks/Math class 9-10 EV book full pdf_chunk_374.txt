Drawing: Bisect the diagonals a and b into two Ln
equal parts. From any ray AX, cut the line “—
!

segment AB equal to c. With centre at Aand B 7°

b
draw two arcs with radius 5 and 3 respectively ¢————
on the same side of AB . Let the arcs intersect F™\ 0 cp
at 0. Join A,0 and B,O. Extend AO to AE ~N._—/
and BO to BF. Now cut 3= OC from OF and 7)
b [AN
5= OD from OF. Join A, D; D, Cand B, C. 4 < BX
Therefore, ABCD is the required parallelogram.
Proof: In AAOB and ACOD,
