2. Pressing the two surfaces more strongly where friction is present.
3. Make the surfaces stationary by stopping the motion which is present on the
two frictional surfaces. Because static friction is more than the sliding friction.
4. Making grooves or waves on the frictional surfaces. Then it can grip the
bottom tightly. If there is water or liquid, it enters the grooves thus reducing
the friction of the surface.
5. To increase the density of air or water.
6. To increase the frictional area in air or water.
7. To remove wheel or ball bearing.
3.9.4 Friction: An essential hazard
All of us have certainly noticed that heat is generated due to friction. In the
winter we create heat by rubbing our hands. The engine of a car becomes hot
