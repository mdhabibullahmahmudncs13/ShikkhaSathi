========================================

the rectangle around its greater side.
Solution: Given that, the length of a rectangle is 12 cm. and width 5 em. If it
is revolved around the greater side, a right circular cylinder is formed with height
h =12 cm and radius of the base r = 5 cm
The whole surface of the produced solid = 27r(r + h)
= 2x 3.1416 x 5(5 + 12) = 534.071 square cm (approx.)
and volume = rh
= 3.1416 x 5% x 12 = 942.48 cube cm (approx.)
The required area of whole surface is 534.071 square cm (approx.) and volume
942.48 cube cm (approx.)
