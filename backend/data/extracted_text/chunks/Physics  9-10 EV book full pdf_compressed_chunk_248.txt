========================================

Put a black dot on the string from which you have hanged the pan with the

rubber band. When there is no weight on the pan, put a black spot on the

board where the black spot of the string remains. This point indicates zero

mass. Now put five coins of five taka in the pan. Since mass of each coin is

8 gm, hence total mass will be 40 gm. Then put another black mark on the

board where the black spot of the string stays. This indicates mass of 40 gm.

Now draw a line from 0 gm to 40 gm marking points and divide the line into

four equal parts. Each division equals 10 gm mass. Now increase the length

of the line and calibrate it to measure more mass. Divide the line

accordingly, as much accurately as you want to measure the mass.
