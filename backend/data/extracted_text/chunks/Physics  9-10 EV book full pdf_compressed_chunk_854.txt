11.4.2 Load Shedding

Each power plant produces a definite amount of electric energy and electricity
produced in all power stations is added to the national grid. We have discussed
carlier that electricity is distributed to consumers from local substations. The
national grid supplies electricity as per the needs of different areas. If the
demand of electricity in an area is more than the electricity produced, then
naturally the required electricity cannot be supplied in that area. Then the
substations are forced to keep electricity supply off in one area to be able to
supply electricity to another area. This process is called load shedding. When the
substation gets the required electricity supply again, it distributes electricity to
that area again.
