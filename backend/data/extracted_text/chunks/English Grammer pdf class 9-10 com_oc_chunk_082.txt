Grammar Point
Form The present continuous is formed by the auxiliary verb be (am, is,
or are) plus the -ing form of the main verb:
It is raining. Rina and Karim are listening to music.
Making questions and negatives in the present simple:
To make a question, we usually put the auxiliary verb be before
the subject: He is studying. Is he studying?
The boys are swimming. Are the boys swimming?
Note: But if what, who, how many, etc. is the subject, then we put the subject
before the auxiliary:
Who is coming for dinner tonight? What is bothering you?
To make a negative in the present continuous, we can add not or n't to the be
verb:
1 am not/I'm not doing anything. We/you/they are not/aren’t working.
