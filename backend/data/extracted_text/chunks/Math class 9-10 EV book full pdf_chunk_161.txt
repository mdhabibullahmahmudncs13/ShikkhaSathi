========================================

According to remainder theorem, if g(a) is divided by (a — 2), then the remainder
will be (2).
G2) =P 42410. 2-8=8+4420-8=32—8=24
cg(2)=24
Calculated remainder is 24.
fla) =d* 9+ (a+1)*
f(a) is a polynomial, if we put a = 1, then the result of the polynomial will be
Z€10.
Therefore (a — 1) is a factor of the polynomial.
co fla) =a = 94a +3a® + 3a+1=2a%+3a® + 3a —8
=2a® — 2a® + 5a* — ba + 8a — 8
=2a*(a— 1) + bala — 1) + 8(a — 1)
