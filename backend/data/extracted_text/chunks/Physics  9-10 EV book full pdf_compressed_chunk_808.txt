========================================

have understood one thing clearly. In solids the atoms and molecules strongly
hold their own positions. If temperature is increased the atoms or molecules start
vibrating, staying at their own position, and don’t move away from their
positions. When you learnt metallic bonds in your chemistry book, you have
seen , some electrons of metal atoms are in a free state which can move from one
place to another. For this reason, those are called conductors. Gold, silver,
«copper, aluminum etc. are good conductors. Charge can be transferred through
S conductors, but we have to remember that this transfer of charge is done by
