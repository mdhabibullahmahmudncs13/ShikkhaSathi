Now, in AABC, ZABC = Zz, BC =a [by construction]
and BA+ AC = BA+ AD = BD = s. Therefore, AABC is the required triangle.
Alternate Method Let the base a, a base adjacent Zz and the sum s of the
other two sides of a triangle be given. It is required to construct the triangle.
Drawing:
1. From any ray BE cut the line segment BC
equal to a. At B of the line segment BC' draw .
an angle ZCBF = Zz. pd
2. Cut a line segment BD equal to s from the ray
BF. PAL yo
3. Join C,D and construct the perpendicular
bisector PQ of C'D. B TCE
4. Let the ray PQ intersect BD at A and CD at
R. Join A,C.
Then, AABC is the required triangle.
Proof: In AACR and AADR, CR = DR, AR = AR and the included ZARC =
included ZARD [right angle]
AACR = NADR.
LAC = AD
