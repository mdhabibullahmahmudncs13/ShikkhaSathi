========================================

equations are 3,3.
Identity: There are two polynomials of same (equal) degree on two sides of equal
sign. Identity will be satisfied by more values than the number of highest degree
of the variable. There is no difference between the two sides of equal sign; that is
why, it is called identity. Such as, (z+ 1)? — (x — 1)? = 4x is an identity; it will be
satisfied for all values of z. So this equation is an identity. Each algebraic formula
is an identity. Such as, (a +b)? = a*+2ab+b?, (a—b)? =a? —2ab+1V?, a* —b* =
(a+b)(a—b), (a+b)*=a®+ 3a®b + 3ab® + b° etc. are identities.
All equations are not identities, In identity = sign is used instead of equal (=) sign. But
as all identities are equations, in the case of identity also, generally the equal sign
is used.
