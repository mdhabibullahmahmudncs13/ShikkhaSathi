Rearranging measures students’ ability to organize some detached sentences into
a coherent and cohesive text. For SSC, Ss will rearrange eight parts of
story/passage (Sec the sample question for SSC.). Test your test item (with

redesign the test. Use linking words/sentence connectors to maintain
cohesion and coherence in the text. Learners do not need to reproduce the
text in their answer scripts. If they arrange the corresponding serial of the texts
