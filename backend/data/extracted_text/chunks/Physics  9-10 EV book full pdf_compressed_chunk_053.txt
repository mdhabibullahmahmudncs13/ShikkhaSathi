1.5 Physical Quantities and Their Measurements
We all know that water becomes ice when it is cooled; it becomes vapor when it
is heated. Peoples have been observing it from the very ancient times. This
knowledge alone cannot be science completely, unless we can say at what
condition and at what temperature water becomes ice after freezing or raising
the temperature at what condition and at what temperature does it start to boil
and becomes vapors. This means, in order to be science, everything has to be
measured. The most important point of science is to be able to explain
everything accurately after measuring them.
