‘Work: Prove that, if two circles touch each other internally, the point of
contact of the tangent and the centres are collinear.

Exercise 8.4
1. Two tangents are drawn from an external point P to the circle with centre

O. Prove that OP is the perpendicular bisector of the chord through the
touch points.

2. Prove that, if two circles are concentric and if a chord of the greater circle
touches the smaller, the chord is bisected at the point of contact.
