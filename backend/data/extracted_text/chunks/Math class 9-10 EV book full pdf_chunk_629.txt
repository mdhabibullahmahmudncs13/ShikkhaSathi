========================================

of the sequence 1,3,5,7,-- is 1, the second term is 2, etc. Followings are the four
examples of sequence :
1,2,3, +m,
1,35, 2n—1,---
14,9, 0?
123 n
23°47 n+l’
‘Work:
1) The general terms of six sequences are given below. Write down the
sequences:
1 n—1 1
1) — 2) —— 3) —
5 @ 2 ® 5
n n
4) — 5) (1) 6) (1)
@ 5 6) CUPL ©) CDT
2) Each of you write a general term and then write the sequence.
Series
If the terms of a sequence are connected successively by + sign, a series is
obtained. Such as, 1 +3 +5 +74 --- is a series. The differences between any
two successive terms of the series are equal. Again, 24+4 +84 16+ --- is a
series. The ratio of two successive terms is equal. Hence, the characterstic of any
0 series depends upon the relation between its two successive terms. Among the
