Question: Show that you are getting back the same amount of energy which is
applied though force is increased.
Answer: Let's suppose force 7, is applied on the smaller piston and the piston
moves by a distance [;.
Therefore, amount of work done yy, — fq,
Force on the bigger piston fg — Ff, (&)

2— nN A
As the water displaced by the smaller piston moves the larger piston by a
distance I, by pushing, therefore
LA, = 1A;

. . Ay

Distance travelled by the larger piston: [, =I; )

A2\, (A
Therefore, amount of work done: W, = F,l, = F; (2) A (%) =FRL
1 2
i.e equal to the work done by the smaller piston.
