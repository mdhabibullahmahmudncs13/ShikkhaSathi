========================================

(v) Among all the characteristics of waves,
the most important is superposition, even \ / \ /
though this is not observed often by our eyes
in our daily lives. Let us consider that two 4 4
waves coming from two different places
reache one place. When one wave is positive b—
another wave is then negative what happens
then? These are the subjects of superposition,
which will give you a deep insight into Figure 7.03: Addition of two
waves, and you will be able be waves can create a large wave, one
understand it very clearly. At present, can even cancel the other.
