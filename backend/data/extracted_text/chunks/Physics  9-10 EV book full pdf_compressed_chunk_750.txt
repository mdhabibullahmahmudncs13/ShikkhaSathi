========================================

imagine, a positively charged rod is brought near the disc. Then the disc will

have negative charge due to induction (Figure 10.08). To make induction of

negative charges, negative charge from other parts of the electroscope will have

to come in the disc and as a result positive charge will be created in the gold

leaves too. This positive charge will push gold leaves apart.

Instead of bringing a positively charged object, if we bring a negatively charged

object, then there will be gap too between the gold plates. This time it will be due

to accumulation of negative charges there.

10.4 Electric Force

‘We have seen earlier that opposite charges attract each other and similar charges

repel each other. But we do not

know yet how attraction or

repulsion works. To know this, we r
