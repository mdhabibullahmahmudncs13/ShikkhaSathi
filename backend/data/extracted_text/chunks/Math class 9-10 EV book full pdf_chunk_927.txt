RB C
Proof: Assume BC and EF are the largest G
sides of AABC and ADEF respectively.
Now, place AABC on ADEF in such a way that point B coincides with point E
and side BC coincides with side EF, and point A falls on the opposite side of D
with respect to EF. Assume point G is the new position of point A.
Since BC = EF, point C will coincide with point F. Therefore, AGEF will be the
new position of AABC. That is, EG = BA, FG = CA, and ZEGF=/BAC.
Connect D and G.
(1)in AEGD, EG = ED [Since EG = BA = ED, and the angles opposite the
equal sides of a triangle are equal.]
Therefore, /ZEDG=/EGD.
(2) In AFGD, FG = FD.
Therefore, ZFDG=/FGD, [as the angles opposite the equal sides of a triangle
are equal.]
(3) Hence, ZEDG+ /FDG=/EGD+ZFGD
or ZEDF=/EGF, i.e., ZBAC=/EDF.
