its center. If physics stops after pronouncing only the existence of gravitation,
this is not enough at all. The knowledge will not be appropriate until we precisely
know the force by which an object of a definite mass attracts another object of
another definite mass and how the force varies with the distance between them.
Newton explained this law of nature properly with the help of the law of
gravitation. The laws of nature can be used in many other places. So, the motion
of a falling body is explained with the help of gravitation, similarly the rotation
of the earth round the sun can also be explained. To know the laws of nature
«properly the scientists analysed them with argumentative discussions, while also
& conducting experiments in the laboratory. Behind the wonderful success of
