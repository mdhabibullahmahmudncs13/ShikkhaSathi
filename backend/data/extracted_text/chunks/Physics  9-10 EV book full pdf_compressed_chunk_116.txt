Figure 2.01: Example of translational motion

There is no obligation that the translational motion will be straight. But the

example of translational motion is not easily available in the case of a curved

path. Figure 2.01 shows how a plane has to move for every point of the plane

travelling equal distances in the same direction. The figure also shows why the

example of translational motion on a curved path is so rare.

Periodic Motion

If the motion of a moving object passes repeatedly through a definite point in

the same direction in the same manner in a definite interval of time, then this motion
