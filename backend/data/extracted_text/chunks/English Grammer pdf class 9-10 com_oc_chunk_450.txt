224 English Grammar and Composition
Objective: You should state very concisely what you accurately want to do. Say
something like, “To develop a career in .....", or you can be mare specific like “to
obtain a position in ... where | can use my skills in...” You can write a few lines to
describe that specifically, but keep in mind that you should show what you can
do for the organization or company you are sending the CV to more than what
the company can do for you. Writing a good objective is difficult, so take some
time to think about what exactly you are going to write there.
