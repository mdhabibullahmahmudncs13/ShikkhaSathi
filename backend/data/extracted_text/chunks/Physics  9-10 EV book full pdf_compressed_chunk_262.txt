========================================

an acceleration by applying a .
force on it. As shown in figure liz d
3.15, we are applying a force F on | fF
the mass from left to right. It will |
be seen that due to friction : L | B
between the wooden piece and the LSS NNR Som 8 ZB em
table, a frictional force f is 1
developed on the wooden piece
and this is lowering the applied Figure 3.15: If a force is applied on a mass
force acting from right to left. then another force may develop in the
reverse direction due to friction.
If you think that due to friction a frictional force is developed from right to left,
so if T apply a force on the wooden piece from the left too, then since the applied
force and the frictional force are in the same direction, I will get an extra force! "
