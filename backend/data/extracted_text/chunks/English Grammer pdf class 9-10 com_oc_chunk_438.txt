========================================

Rajshahi Collegiate School observed the Victory Day 2015 in a befitting manner
this year. All the students and teachers gathered in the school ground at 7:30
a.m. The day wore a festive look. Every one of the students held a national flag.
With a big banner, the teachers and students took out a rally that marched
towards the Central Shahid Minar. They sang songs of the liberation war and
placed floral wreaths in the pedestal of the Shahid Minar. Hundreds of other
organizations also went to the Shahid Minar. About 5000 students of the school
joined the programme. Various competitions were held in our school.
Throughout the day there were cultural activities of different types. We also
commemorated the war martyrs by offering prayers.
