CV & Cover Letter 225
Computer skills: Write if you know—Microsoft word or anything else of
computer.
Hobbies: List your hobbies if space is left on the page. They look fine on a CV,
showing that you are not a no-life workaholic, but a normal person. You can
introduce other headings that suit your needs. Have a references section,
where you should list contact details of 2 or 3 persons who would write letters
of recommendation or reference letters for you. These are the usual components
of a CV. Print the CV on plain-white paper. You should never send a CV without
a cover letter. If the advertisement does not say anything about a cover letter,
you still should send one. Send the CV with covering letter in a matching
Ad size envelope.
