========================================

In Figure 10.12 (a), the lines of force of two opposite charges are shown. You

can see, the lines of force of one charge ended up in another charge. Where the

magnitude of the electric field is higher, the number of lines of force is higher.

Also, when the figure is seen, it gives a feeling that the two charges are

attracting one another. In Figure 10.12 (b), both the charges are positive and

from the figure it can be seen that, the two charges are repelling one another. Not

only that, in the middle portion of two charges the electric field due to one

charge is neutralized by the electric field of the other. As a result the number of

lines of force is less, and there is a point in the middle where the magnitude of 8
