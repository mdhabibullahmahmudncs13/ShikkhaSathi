174 Physics
liquid, i.e., the bulb will expand a little bit.
After that if we continue applying heat, the height of the liquid will increase. As
the expansion of liquids is more than solids, we will observe that finally the level
of the liquid has reached mark C from B after passing the mark A.
If we multiply the height AB by the cross section of the tube, we will get the
expansion V, of the bulb. Again if we multiply the height B_. by the cross section,
we will get the real expansion V, of the liquid. Here the apparent expansion V,
is
Va=V= Vp
6.3.3 Expansion of Gases
A solid has both shape and volume, so no problem arises in understanding the
expansion of the solid. Though a liquid has no definite shape, it has a definite
