========================================

Subsets of P are {z,y, =}, {ey}, (x. 2}. {v. 2}. {ae} {}. {=}. 2.

Proper subsets of P are {x,y}, {z, 2}, {y. 2}, {=}, {y}, {=}, ©

Observation: If number of elements of a set is n, then it has 2" subsets, and
number of proper subsets is 2" — 1.

Equivalent Set

If two sets have the same elements, then they are said to be equivalent sets. For
example, A = {3,5,7} and B = {5,3,3, 7} are two equivalent sets, then they are
denoted by A = B. Note that A= B if and only if AC Band BC A

Again, if A ={3,5,7}, B={5,3,3,7} and C' = {7,7,3,5,5}, then sets A, B and
C are equivalent sets. That is A =B =C

Observation: If order of elements in the set are changed or certain element is
repeated set is not changed.
