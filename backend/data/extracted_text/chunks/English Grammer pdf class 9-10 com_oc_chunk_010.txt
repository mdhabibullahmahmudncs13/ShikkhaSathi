2 English Grammar and Composition
Activity 1 Notice the underlined words in the following passage and say
what they refer to:
Rajshahi is a divisional city in Bangladesh. It is in the western part of the
country. It stands on the river Padma. My friend Alamgir lives in this city. He is
a professor of History. | often visit him and discuss many things with him. He
speaks good English.
These are all proper nouns. A proper noun is the name of a particular person,
place or thing. For example, “Rajshahi” is the name of a particular city and
“History” is the name of a particular subject. Think of the other proper nouns
in the passage. A proper noun usually begins with a capital letter. A proper
noun is usually singular but some proper nouns are plural in form.
