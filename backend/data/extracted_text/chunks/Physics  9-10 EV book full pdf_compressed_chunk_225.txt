Force 75
3.6 Effect of Force on Motion: Newton’s Second Law
In the football ground we always see a player kicking a stationary football and
directing it to distant places by creating motion. At the time of the kick, when the
player touches the ball, only at that instant, force is applied on the ball. The
stationary ball goes into motion due to this force.
We can apply force also for a long time instead of just for a moment. By pushing
a stationary go-cart for a long time and we can release it after setting it into
motion. It can move for a while until it ceases its motion due to friction.
The direction of velocity can also be changed by the application of force. When
a bowler throws a cricket ball towards the batsman, then the batsman can direct
