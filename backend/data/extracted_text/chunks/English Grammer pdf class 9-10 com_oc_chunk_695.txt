316 English Grammar and Composition
13. Completing a story
There will be the beginning of a story in the question paper. Students will continue the
story and complete it. The answer will vary here. Completing a story when given at
classes 6-8 should be more guided (See sample question for classes 6-7) where
question setter not only begins a story but also provides with some clues for the
extension of ideas. Students will complete the story following the clues. A good idea is
to mention the word limit when there is no clues for the students. Assess the paragraph
from different aspects such as grammar, ideas. communication. organisation etc.: do
not only assess the paragraph only from the perspective of grammar accuracy.
