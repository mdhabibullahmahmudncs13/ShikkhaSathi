motion, then retardation starts. If the car ceases its motion, then both its velocity
and acceleration become zero. You may think that the examples of uniform
acceleration are rare.
There is an amazing example of uniform acceleration which we see in our
surroundings. That is the acceleration due to gravity. Near the earth’s surface, the
value of this acceleration is 9.8 ms™. If we release an object from rest from above the
carth, then its velocity increases according to the equation v = gz.
2.7 Equations of Motion
Since we discuss only linear motion, the quantities we have talked about so far
are:

u: initial velocity

a: acceleration

t: elapsed time

v: velocity after elapsed time
