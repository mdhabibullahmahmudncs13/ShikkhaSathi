========================================

the graph point of P and a the coordinates of P. To convert a straight line into
a number line the co-ordinates of two points are taken as 0 and 1 respectively.
Thus a unit distance and the positive direction are fixed in the straight line. For
this, it is also admitted that,
Postulate 8: Any straight line AB can be converted into a number line such
that the coordinate of A is 0 and that of B is positive.
Remarks: Postulate 6 is known as distance postulate and Postulate 7 as ruler
postulate and Postulate 8 as ruler placement postulate.
Geometrical figures are drawn to make geometrical description clear. The model
of a point is drawn by a thin dot by tip of a pencil or pen on a paper. The model of
a straight line is constructed by drawing a line along a ruler. The arrows at ends
