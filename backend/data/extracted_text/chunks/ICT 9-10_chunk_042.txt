========================================

C. E-settlement Records : The duplicate of land settlement records can be
collected through this service. Previously employees of the land settlement
department would supply the information to the applicants from big record
books after filling up the prescribed forms. The applicants had to be present
physically in the office and the employees of the concerned department
would prepare it manually. Because of the e-service, applicants at home and
abroad can receive the settlement records, paying the required fees.
