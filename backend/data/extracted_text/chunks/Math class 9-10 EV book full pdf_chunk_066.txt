method and Set Builder Method.
Roster method: In this method all members are listed and put inside {} and
if there are more than one element, then elements are separated by commas. For
example, A = {a,b}, B = {2.4,6}, C' = { Niloy, Shuvro, Tisha } etc.
Set builder method: In this method all elements are not listed rather their
common property is described. For example, A = {x : x is an odd natural number
+. B = {x : x is the first five students of class IX } etc. Here, by ‘:" has been
expressed such that. Since in this method element of the set is specified by rules,
this method is called Rule Method.
Example 1. Express A = {7,14,21, 28} in set building method.
Solution: The elements of A are 7,14, 21,28.
Here, each element is a multiple of 7 and not exceeding 28.
