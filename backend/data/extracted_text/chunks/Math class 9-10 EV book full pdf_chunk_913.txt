Proof:
(1) The lines AB and DC are parallel and AC is
their transversal. [Alternate angles are equal]
Therefore, “BAC = alternate ACD.
(2) The lines BC and AD are parallel and BD is
their transversal [Alternate angles are equal]
Therefore, “BDC = alternate ~ABD.
(3) Now, between AAOB and ACOD BAC — 2 ACD
ZOAB = 20CD, Z0BA = 20DC and ’ ~
i an and ZBDC = Z ABD
AB=DC.
So, AAOB = ACOD. [ ASA theorem]
Therefore, 40 =CO and BO = DO. (Proved)
Activity
1. Prove that, if the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, it is a
parallelogram.
Theorem 4
Two diagonals of a rectangle are equal and bisect each other.
Proposition: : Let the diagonals AC and D Cc
BD of the rectangle ABCD intersect at O.
It is required to prove that,
(i) AC = BD
