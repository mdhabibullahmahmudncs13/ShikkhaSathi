Construction of Triangles
Every triangle has three sides and three angles. But, to specify the shape and
size of a triangle, all sides and angles need not to be specified. For example, as
sum of the three angles of a triangle is two right angles, one can easily find the
measurement of the third angle when the measurement of the two angles of the
triangle is given. Again, from the theorems on congruence of triangles it is found that
the following combination of three sides and angles are enough to be congruent.
That is, a combination of these three parts of a triangle is enough to construct a
unique triangle. In class seven we have learnt how to construct triangles from the 5
