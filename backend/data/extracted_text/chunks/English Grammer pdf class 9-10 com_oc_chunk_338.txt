168 English Grammar and Compasition
Grammar point
Every sentence must have a subject, but sometimes the subject does not
mean anything, like the introductory ‘there’ and ‘it’ in the above sentences.
When we don’t want to put a new information at the beginning of a sentence,
we write it in a different way using there/it at the beginning. There’ and ‘it’ at
the beginning of a sentence are also called ‘empty subjects’.
Notice that there/it is followed by the verb be.
Form : There +be e.g. Theres... [There are ..,
There was .../There were ...
It + be e.g Itis../itwas...
Use
We use the introductory ‘there’ to say that something exists or existed in the
past:
There is a lake in the university campus.
There were hundreds of migratory birds.
