========================================

this resultant force will start working on the object and the body will oscillate.
This is another example of the unbalanced force.
Three forces together can produce the balanced condition too. If a heavy book is
tied by a rope and pulled by the two terminals of the rope from two sides, it is
possible to suspend the book in a stationary state (Figure 3.03). Since the book
is in the stationary state, consequently here the weight of the book #7 and the two
tensions of the rope 7, and 7, combine to produce a zero resultant force.
