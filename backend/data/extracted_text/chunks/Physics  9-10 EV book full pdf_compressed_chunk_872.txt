========================================

(b) Why does the resistance of conductor increase with increasing
temperature?

(c) Determine the resistance of the copper wire.

(d) Analyze the logic of using copper wire.

2. Alvi uses a bulb of 220V-100W during his studies for 3 hours daily. His
brother Alif uses a table lamp of 220V-40W for 4 hours daily. The cost of each
unit of electrical energy is 3.5 taka.

(a) Write down Ohm’s law.

(b) Explain, what will be the change in resistance of a conductor if the
length is increased by 5 times (provided that the temperature, material
and area of cross-section remain unchanged)?

(c) Determine the current of the lamp used by Alif.

(d) Who is more economical, Alvi or Alif (considering money)? Analyze
with mathematical arguments.
