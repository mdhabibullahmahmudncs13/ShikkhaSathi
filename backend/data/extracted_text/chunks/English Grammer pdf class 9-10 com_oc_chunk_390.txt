Grammar Point
In informal speech we sometimes use the same tense that the person used
in the direct speech. Besides when we want to say something that someone
says about future we use the same tense used in the direct speech
Example
Hannan: I'm going to Bandarban tomorrow.
Hannan says that he is going to Bandarban the next day.
