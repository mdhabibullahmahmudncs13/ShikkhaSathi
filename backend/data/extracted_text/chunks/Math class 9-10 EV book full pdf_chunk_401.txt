Chapter 8. Circle 169
The arc of a circle
An arc is the piece of the circle between any two
points of the circle. Look at the pieces of the circle
between two points A and B in the figure. We find
that there are two pieces, one comparatively larger
and the other smaller. The larger one is called the ()
major arc and the smaller one is called the minor A B
arc. A and B are the terminal points of this arc R
and all other points are its internal points. With an Cy
internal fixed point R the arc is called arc ARB and A B
is expressed by the symbol ARB. Again, sometimes Hb
minor arc is expressed by the symbol AB. The two
points A and B of the circle divide the circle into two
arcs. The terminal points of both arcs are A and B
