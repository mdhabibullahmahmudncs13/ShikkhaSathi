========================================

If going two kilometers more by a cycle you cross a six kilometer path total and
reach point C, then your displacement will be the straight line AC with an
arrow, whose magnitude is 1.5 kilometer and the direction of the arrow is along
your displacement. Though you covered more distance along the curved path
but your displacement is still small. Therefore the more distance you cover, the
more will be the displacement is not true. The difference between the initial and
final position is the displacement.

Starting from the point A, the distance towards point B is 4 km along the
curved path, similarly the distance between point B and point Ais 4 km ie.
both are equal. But notice that the displacement from A to B and the §
