========================================

expensive machine (e.g. computer, fridge) is connected to the current, you will
see that besides high potential and neutral, there is another third connection,
which is the ground. Generally this is connected to the body or cover of the
machine. If the machine is electrified accidentally, then current directly flows
from the cover or body to ground. A fuse burns due to this flow of electricity and
., makes the machine safe. So, if anyone accidentally touches it, he is not
g electrocuted.
