========================================

pate in the wave propagation.

When a stone is thrown into a pond, a single wave is created that spreads

outward through the water. When the vibrations of a tuning fork travel through

a medium—whether air, liquid, or solid—we describe this as a sound wave

propagating through the medium. When the oscillations of electric and magnet-

ic fields transfer energy, this is called an electromagnetic wave. Examples of

electromagnetic waves include light waves, gamma rays, and microwaves.

These types of waves do not require a medium to propagate.

7.2.1 Characteristics of Waves

Here, we will discuss some properties of waves. The first property below (i)

applies only to mechanical waves, while the remaining properties (ii-v) apply to

almost all types of waves.
