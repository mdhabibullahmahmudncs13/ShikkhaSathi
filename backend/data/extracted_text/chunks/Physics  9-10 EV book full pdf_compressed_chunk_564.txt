travels from one medium to another then its wavelength changes. Therefore,
when waves propagate through different medium, its velocity or wavelength
changes, but frequency or time period never changes.

Answer: From the information that is position (m)
given in the figure, only amplitude (0.1
m) and wavelength (2 m) of the wave i .
can be determined. It is not possible to Figure 7.06 : A wave with respect
determine time period, frequency or to position
velocity from the information that are
