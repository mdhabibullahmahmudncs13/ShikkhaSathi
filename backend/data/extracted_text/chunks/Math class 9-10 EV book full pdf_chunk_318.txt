According to definition (b) the perpendicular distance of any point of one of the
parallel lines from the other is always equal. Perpendicular distance is the length
of the perpendicular from any point on one of the lines to the other. Conversely,
if the perpendicular distances of two points on any of the lines to the other are
equal, the lines are parallel. This perpendicular distance is known as the distance
of the parallel lines.
The definition (¢) is equivalent to the fifth postulate of Euclid. This definition is
more useful in geometric proof and constructions.
Observe that, through a point not on a line, a unique line parallel to it can be
drawn.
