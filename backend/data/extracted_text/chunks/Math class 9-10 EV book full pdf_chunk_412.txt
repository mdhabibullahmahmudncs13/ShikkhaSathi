Theorem 23. The sum of the two opposite angles of a quadrilateral inscribed
in a circle is two right angles.
Let ABCD be a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle D
with centre O. It is required to prove that, ZABC +
ZADC = 2 right angles and /BAD + /BCD = 2 A c
right angles.
Drawing: Join O, A and O,C'. B
Proof:
Step 1. Standing on the same arc ADC, the angle at centre reflex
ZAOC = 2 (ZABCat the circumference)
that is, reflex ZAOC' = 2ZABC' [The angle subtended by an arc at the centre
is double of the angle subtended by it at the circle]
Step 2. Again, standing on the same arc ABC, the angle at the centre ZAOC = 2
(£ZADC at the circumference)
that is, ZAOC' = 2/ADC [The angle subtended by an arc at the
