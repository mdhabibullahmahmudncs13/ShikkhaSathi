========================================

Y= 20 minutes © 20x 60s oS
Notice that, we have used the word average speed instead of the word
speed. Because, while you are riding the cycle, sometimes you rode fast and
sometimes you rode slow. So we cannot talk about the ‘instantaneous’ speed,
rather we can talk about the average speed in the time interval.
Let us try to determine velocity now. Like speed, we cannot calculate
instantaneous velocity. In this time interval, you rode the cycle at different
velocities. The velocity has changed due to the motion being fast or slow. Again
the velocity has changed due to the change of direction. Considering these
changes, the magnitude of the average velocity will be:
Average velocity = displacement/time
Magnitude of average velocity = Magnitude of displacement/time
