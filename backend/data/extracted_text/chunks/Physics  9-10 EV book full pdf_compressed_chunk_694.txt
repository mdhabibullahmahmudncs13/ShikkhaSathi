9.3.3 Prism i

Interms of optics, if a transparent 2a

medium is bound by another F: i =

two surfaces of a transparent ee

medium are not parallel, this is | Co .

called prism. The light goes out ina Figure 9.12 : Prism is used instead

direction parallel to the direction IMIFTOr in periscope

in which it enters the transparent

medium. Though the direction

remains unchanged, the light ray bends a little bit from the main ray. In the case

of prism the direction of light changes (Figure 9.13). While entering the first

surface the ray bends toward the normal. The second surface is not parallel, so

when going out from this surface the light ray moves away from the normal but

cannot move towards the main ray. Though in a prism the direction of light
