========================================

pulling is termed as ‘applying force’ and the change of the length is termed as
‘deformation’. The word deformation is taken negatively in our daily life. But
you should not take it negatively here. It is just a change in condition!
Therefore, you understand that when a force is applied to an object, a
deformation happens inside it (and for this deformation, a counter force is
created). If the force is withdrawn, deformation stops and the object comes back
to its initial condition. This property of a substance is called elasticity. But it
should be remembered that the quantity of the applied force has a limit. If the
limit is crossed, the substance will not be able to come back to its initial
condition. A permanent deformation could take place. This limit is termed as the
