Again, OD, OF and OF respectively are perpendiculars to BC, AC and AB at

their extremities.

Hence, the circle lying inside AABC' touches its sides at the points D, E and F'

respectively.

Hence, the circle DEF is the required inscribed circle of AABC'

Construction 11. To draw an ex-circle of a given triangle.

Let ABC be a triangle. It is required to draw its

ex-circle. That is, to draw a circle which touches one F

side of triangle and the other two sides produced.

Drawing: Let AB and AC be produced to D and L

F respectively. BM and CN, the bisectors of ZDBC

and ZF CB respectively are drawn. Let E be their C

point of intersection. From FE, perpendicular FH is

drawn on BC and let EH intersects BC at H. With
