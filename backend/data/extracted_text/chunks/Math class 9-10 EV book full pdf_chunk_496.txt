2. While drawing 45° angle, it is needed base = perpendicular.
3. While drawing 60° angle, it is needed base < perpendicular.
Example 1. The angle of elevation at the top of a tower at a point on the
ground is 30° at a distance of 75 metre from the foot. Find the height of the
tower.
Solution: Let, the height of the tower is AB = h metre. The angle of elevation at
C' from the foot of the tower BC = 75 metre of A on the ground is ZAC'B = 30°
AB
From AABC we get, tan/ACB = BC
h 1 li i
or, tan 30° = 7 or, 7 = = or, V3h = 75 A
or,h = E
RE hm
53
or, h = 3 [multiplying denominator and 2
numerator by V3) C H B
or, h = 25/3 75 m
oh = 43.301 (approx.).
.-. Height of the tower is 43.30 metre (approx.)
