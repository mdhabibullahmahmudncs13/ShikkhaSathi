2) The mid-points of the opposite sides parallel to the base of rectangle of the
histogram have been fixed for drawing frequency polygon from histogram.
The mid-points have been joined by line segments to draw the frequency
polygon (shown in the adjacent figure). The mid-points of the first and the
a last rectangles have been joined with z-axis representing the class interval
S by the end points of line segments to show the frequency polygon attractive
