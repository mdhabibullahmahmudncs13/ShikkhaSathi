========================================

data, we get the arithmetic mean. But this method is complex, time consuming

and there is every possibility of committing mistake for large numbers of data. In
such cases, the data are tabulated through classification and the arithmetic mean
is determined by short-cut method.

Example 7. The frequency distribution table of the marks obtained by the

students of a class is as follows. Find the arithmetic mean of the marks.

Class interval [ 25 —34 [35 — 44 [ 45-54 75-8485 94
Solution: Here class interval is given and that is why it is not possible to know
the individual marks of the students. In such case, it becomes necessary to know
