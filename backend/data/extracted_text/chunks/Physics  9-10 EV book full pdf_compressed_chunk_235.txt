Force 79
force ( Figure 3.07) acting between them is F, then
mpm;
F= G2
Tr
Here, G is the gravitational constant and its value is:
6.67 x 1011 Nm?kg 2
We have to remember that the mass mz, attracts mass m, towards itself by the
force F; also the mass m, attracts mass m, towards itself.
Of the two masses, if one is our earth
and we consider that the mass of the r
earth is M and we let another body of m m,
mass m be kept over the earth’s surface, . oo
. Figure 3.07: Gravitational
then, the earth will attract the mass m
3 force between two masses
towards its centre by a force F.
mM
F=6Fe
This force is actually the weight of the object. Here, R is the distance of the
object of mass m from the centre of the earth. This is not the distance of mass m
