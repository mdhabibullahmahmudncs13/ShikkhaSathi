Example 1. A and B traverse the fixed distance in #; and ¢; minutes. Find
the ratio of the average velocity of A and B
Solution: Let the average velocities of A and B be v; metre and vy metre
per minute respectively. So, in time #; minutes A traverses vif; metre and in
t> minutes B traverses vst; metra. According to the problem, vit; = wats
ub . FPS . .
== 5 Here, the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of
V2 1
time.
‘Work:
1) Express 3.5:5.6 into 1 : a and b;.1.
2) If z:y=>5:6, then what is the value of 3x : 5y = what?
Transformation of ratio
Here, the quantities of ratios are positive numbers.
1. ifa:b=c:d, then b:a=d: c [Invertendo]
Proof: Given that,
a_c
bd
or, ad = be [multiplying both the sides by bd]
ad be .
