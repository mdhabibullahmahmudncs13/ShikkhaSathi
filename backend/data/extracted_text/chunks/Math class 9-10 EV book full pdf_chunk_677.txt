Proof:
Step 1. Since, DA || CE and BE is their transversal [by construction]
LAEC = ZBAD [corresponding angles]
Again, DA || CE and AC is their transversal .. ZACE = ZCAD
[corresponding angles]
Step 2. But ZBAD = ZCAD [supposition]
SL LAEC = ZACE Hence, AC' = AE [Chapter 6 Theorem 8]
BD BA
Step 3. Again, since DA || CE Therefore, oC = AB [step 2]
Step 4. But AE = AC
BD BA
DC AC
Theorem 31. If any side of a triangle is divided internally, the line segment
from the point of division to the opposite vertex bisects the angle at the vertex.
Special Nomination: Let ABC be a triangle E
and the line segment AD from vertex A divides
the side BC' at D such that BD : DC = BA : n
AC. Tt is required to prove that AD bisects
