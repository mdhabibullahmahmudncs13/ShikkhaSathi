13.1.2 Betaray
A Beta particle is actually an electron (it is of courise a matter of wonder that a
nucleus is consists of neutrons and protons only, so how does an electron come
out from a nucleus?) For this, inside the nucleus a neutron has to dissociate into
a proton and an electron.
n> ptte + ¥
That is, a charge-less neutron is converted into a positively charged proton and a
negatively charged electron, so the total amount of charge remains unchanged.
In the right side of the equation, ( v) indicates the anti particle of a neutrino
(anti-neutrino), a mysterious particle of the world of physics, which is
“ . .
2S chargeless and its mass is very small.
