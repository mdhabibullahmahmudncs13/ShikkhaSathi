3. If the point D of the circuit shown in Figure 11.19 (a) is connected with the
earth, what are the voltages at the points A, B, C and D? What is the value of I?
4. If instead of point D, the point C is connected with the earth of the circuit
shown in Figure 11.19 (a), then what is the voltage? What is the magnitude of I?
5. If the point D of the circuit shown in Figure 11.19 (b) is connected with the
carth, what are the voltages at the points A, B, C and D?
