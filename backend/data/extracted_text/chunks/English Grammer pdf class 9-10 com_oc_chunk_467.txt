5. Make sure your e-mail is readable: There is nothing more annoying than an
e-mail that cannot be read for various reasons, whether it’s because of poor
grammar or spelling, or the use of inappropriate fonts and abbreviations, or
even worse, an e-mail written in bright colors or all capital letters. It is always
