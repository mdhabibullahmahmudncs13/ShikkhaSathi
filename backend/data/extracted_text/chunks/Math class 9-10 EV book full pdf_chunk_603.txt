Solution: Given equations are:
2c +5y=—14...(1)
dr —5y=17...(2)
—2x— 14
From equation (1) we get, 5y = —14 — 2x, or, y = res
J
Taking some convenient values of x in the equation, we find the corresponding
values of y and make the adjoining table:
BOE

.-. three points on the graph of the equation are: (3,—4), (3 3) ,(—2,-2).
. dr —17
Again, from equation (2) we get, 5y = 4x — 17 , or, y = a
Taking some convenient values of x in the equation, we find the corresponding
values of y and make the adjoining table:

In a graph paper let XOX’ and YOY’ be
respectively the X- axis and Y- axis and O is
the origin. ¢
