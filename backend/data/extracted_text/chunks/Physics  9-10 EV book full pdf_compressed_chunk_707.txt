draw a normal on this axis from image of X.
Imagine two rays from point X, one is XP which is incident on the lens in
parallel with the axis. This will diverge when emerged and will appear to
diverge from the focus, so if a line is drawn from the focus F to P and
elongated, then we’ll find
that ray. Let us draw the
second ray from point X Cr 3
towards the center of the X f
lens. According to the fa
rules of thin lenses it will | ’
emerge directly along the - I
direction of XT. The point Y F v Fiot R
where XT and FS T
intersect each other is the
image X of X. If we draw
a normal from X' on the
axis we will get the image
X'Y'of XY. Figure 9.20 : An object looks small in a concave
