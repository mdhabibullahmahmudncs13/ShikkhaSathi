========================================

In this series, the difference between two terms is called common difference. The
common difference of the mentioned series is 2. The numbers of terms of the
series are fixed. That is why the series is finite series. It is to be noted that if
the terms of the series are not fixed, the series is called infinite series, such as,
1+4+7+10+--- is an infinite series. In an arithmetic series, the first term and
the common difference are generally denoted by a and d respectively. Then by
definition, if the first term is a, the second term is a + d, the third term is a + 2d
etc. Hence, the series will be a + (a +d) + (a + 2d) + ---.

Determining common term of an arithmetic series

Let the first term of an arithmetic series be a and the common difference be d.
Then the terms of the series are:
