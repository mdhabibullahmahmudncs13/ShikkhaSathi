Waves and Sound 203
Bats have eyes and pretty good eye sight, yet they use echo during flight.
While flying a bat uses its throat to produce sound, if there is an obstacle in the front,
the sound returns after reflection, and the bat can estimate the distance from the
time of the returning sound. For this reason, the bat can fly even in dark
without being obstructed. We cannot hear the sound produced by the bat;
because the sound is ultrasound i.e. frequency of the sound is beyond our
hearing range. Bats can produce sound of frequency 100 kHz or more.
7.3.2 Variation of Velocity of Sound Table 7.0: velocity of sound
In air, velocity of sound is proportional to the in different medium
square root of temperature. i.e.
