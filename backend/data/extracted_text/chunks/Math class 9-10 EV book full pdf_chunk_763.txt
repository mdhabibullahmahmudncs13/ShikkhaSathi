Solution:
Let, the length of a diagonal of rhombus ABCD is BD = D C
dy = 10 metre and another diagonal d, metre. NT
. 1
Area of the rhombus = Fd sq. meter
1 120 x 2
As per question, Ftd = 120 or, dy = 0 =24 AN
metre. A B
We know, the diagonals of rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Let the
diagonals interset at the point O.
10 24
.OD=0B= 5 metre = 5 metre and OA = OC = = metre = 12 metre.
In the right-angled AAOD
AD? = OA? + OD? = 12° + 5%
SAD =13
.. The length of each sides of the rhombus is 13 metre.
The perimeter of the rhombus = 4 x 13 metre = 52 metre
The required length of the diagonal is 24 metre and perimeter 52 metre.
Example 14. The lengths of two parallel sides of a trapezium are 91 cm and
