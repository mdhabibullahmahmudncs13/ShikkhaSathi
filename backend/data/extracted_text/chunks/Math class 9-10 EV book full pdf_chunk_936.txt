========================================

value of other variable.
Example 1. Solve the equations
x+y=7
x—y=3
Solution : Given equations are
X43 =Teooorrcenn()
X=y=3u....(2)
In equation (2) expressing x in terms if y we get
x=y+3......03
From (3) putting the value of x in (I) we get,y+3+y=7
or, 2y=7-3
or, 2y=4
or, y=7-3
Soy=2
