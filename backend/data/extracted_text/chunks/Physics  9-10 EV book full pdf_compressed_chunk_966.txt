this point, the teacher showed Roni a poster in the physics lab, explaining that if
a | kg sample of this element is leftuntouched, after eight hundred years, the
mass of the same radioactive atoms remaining in the sample would be 250 g.
(a) What is radioactivity?
(b) Explain the reasons for the special radioactive hazard symbolsdisplayed on
vehicles transporting uranium fuel.
(c) What is the half-life of the element displayed on the poster in the physics lab?
