Force 81
Using Newton's second law of motion is quite simple. For each mass, Newton's
second law should be applied in every direction, with the vector sum of forces on
the left side of the equation and the mass multiplied by acceleration on the right
side. Since force and acceleration are vector quantities, both the magnitude and
the direction must be considered. According to the conventions, the quantities
pointing to the right are considered positive, while those pointing to the left are
regarded as negative. Similarly, the quantities directed upwards are treated as
positive, whereas those directed downwards are treated as negative.
