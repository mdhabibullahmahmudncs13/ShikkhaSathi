========================================

Though we have known it here for the first time, it’s unit is very familiar to us.
If 1 Joule work is done per second then we say, work done is 1 watt or
transformation of energy takes place. If we switch on a light bulb of 100 watt
that means, in this bulb 100 J energy is being spent in each second. When we
read in the newspaper that a 1000 MW nuclear power plant will be built in our
country that means in that power plant, 1000 x 10° J electrical energy will be
produced in each second.
4.8 Efficiency
We have said earlier that a certain amount of energy is wasted every time while
transforming energy from one form to another. So we have to give a little
more energy than the amount of work we want to do. We use various types of
