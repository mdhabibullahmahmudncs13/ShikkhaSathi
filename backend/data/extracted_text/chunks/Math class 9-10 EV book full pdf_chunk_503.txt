Example 6. A pole is broken such that the undetached broken part makes an
angle of 30° with the other and touches the ground at a distance of 10 metre form
its foot. Find the length of the pole.
Solution:
Let, the total height of the pole is AB = h A
metre. It breaks at the height of BC' = x metre
without separation and makes an angle with the
other, ZBCD = 30° and touches the ground at a
distance BD = 10 metre from the foot. c
Here, CD = AC = AB — BC = (h — x) metre hm
