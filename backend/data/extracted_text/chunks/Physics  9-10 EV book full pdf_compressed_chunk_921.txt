========================================

by emitting a kind of radiation. We call this process radioactivity. The radiation
that comes out from the nucleus is called a radioactive ray.
It is not the fact that when proton number exceeds 82 (atomic number more than 82)
only then the nucleus becomes radioactive. Any nucleus of other atoms may be
radioactive too. We have classified atoms on the basis of their electron number
which is equal to the number of protons. External properties, nature, chemical
properties; every feature of an element depends on the classification of
electrons. So the number of neutrons of an atom can be different even if the
number of electrons and protons is equal. These types of elements, with different
numbers of neutrons, are called isotopes of that element. So, an isotope of an
