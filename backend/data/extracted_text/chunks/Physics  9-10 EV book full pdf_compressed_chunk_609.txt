Figure 8.04: If a candle is placed between two parallel mirrors, the image
X' and image of image X' i.e. X"", X""...will be formed.
Here two laws of reflection have been stated. But everything about reflection is
not yet discussed. The most important matter has not been discussed yet, that is
how much will it reflect? If a mirror is used for reflection, it reflects fully. But

mediums. Fresnel's law describes how much it will reflect. You will learn more
about it in higher classes. The main thing is, the larger the angle of incidence, the
more the amount of reflection (Figure 8.05). In normal glass, light is reflected
