equations. In class VIII, we have solved such system of equations and learnt to
form and solve simultaneous equations related to real life problems. In this
chapter, these have been discussed in more details.
First, we consider the equation 2x 4 y = 12. This is a simple equation in two
variables.
In the equation, can we get such values of = and y on the left hand side for which
the sum of twice the first with the second will be equal to 12 of the right hand
side; that is, the equation will be satisfied by those two values?
Now, we fill in the following chart from the equation 2x-+y=12:
