34 English Grammar and Composition
Grammar point
Form: The simple present is formed by a main verb without an auxiliary:
| teach English at a college. She works in a bank.
Making a question in the simple present:
When we make a question in the simple present with the verb be, we put the
subject after the verb: He is a writer. Is he a writer?
With other verbs, we add the auxiliary_do/does before the subject and the
main verb (in the infinitive): He teaches English. Does he teach English?
They live in Khulna. Do they live in Khulna?
If we are using an auxiliary or modal (is, will, have, can, etc.) in a question, we
put the subject after the auxiliary or modal:
He is reading. Is he reading?
He can swim well. Can he swim well?
