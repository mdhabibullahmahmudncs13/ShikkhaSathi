Mensuration
The length of a line, the area of a place, the volume of a solid etc. are
determined for practical purposes. In the case of measuring any such quantity,
another quantity of the same kind having some definite magnitude is taken as
unit. The ratio of the quantity measured and the unit defined in the above
process is the amount of the quantity.
tity measured
i.e. magnitude = = Quantity measured a v a
Unit quantity
In the case of a fixed unit, every measure is a number which denotes how many
times the magnitude of the unit is the magnitude of the quantity measured. For
example, the bench is 5 meter long. Here metre is a definite length which is taken
as a unit and in comparison to that the bench is 5 times in length.
