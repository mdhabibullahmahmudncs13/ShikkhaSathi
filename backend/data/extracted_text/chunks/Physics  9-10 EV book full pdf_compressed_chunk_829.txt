Figurel1.07: Some symbols that are used in a circuit.
(a) The amount of current that comes out from the higher potential of a source
(battery cell, generator whatever may be) after flowing through the entire circuit,
just the same amount of current comes back to the lower potential.
(b) The amount of current that enters at any point of a circuit, the same amount
