Appendix 401
The solid of figure | is a rectangular solid. It has six rectangular faces or surfaces
each of which is a rectangular region. The two mutual opposite faces are equal
and parallel. So, the area of each pair of opposite faces are equal.
The solid of figure 2 is a square solid. It has six mutually
equal square faces or surfaces each of which is a square
region.

Figure-2
Again, two mutually opposite faces are parallel. The square solid is called cube.
The intersecting line segments of each of two faces are called the edges or sides
of the cube. All the edges or sides of a cube are equal. So, the area of all faces are
equal.
