========================================

cardboard and place a candle before it. On the opposite side of the board,
hold a white paper, as shown in Figure 8.14. If you do not allow any other
light to fall on the white paper, you will see an image of the flame of the
candle. By moving the white paper in forward or backward, the size of
the image can be made small or big. Is the image real or virtual? Straight
or inverted? Is it equidistant or not? Large or small?
You can understand, the image is real, inverted, clear at all distances and
as far as it forms, larger in size. Through this process, a pin hole camera
is made.
