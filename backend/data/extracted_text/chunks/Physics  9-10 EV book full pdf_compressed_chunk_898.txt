During this experiment, to change the magnetic field in the coil, we brought the
magnet towards the coil away from it. If we could change the magnetic field in
an other way, then we would observe the same thing.
Another way of changing the magnetic field in the coil is to bring another coil
near it (instead of bringing the magnet) and producing magnetic field in the
second coil by flowing current through it. If a battery and a switch are connected
with the second coil to produce magnetic field in it, then by turning the switch
‘on’, a magnetic field can be produced in the coil, again turning the switch “off”,
the magnetic field can be removed. Keeping the second coil near the first coil,
