Chapter 14. Ratio, Similarity and Symmetry 291
Theorem 28. A straight line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersects
the other two sides or those sides produced proportionally.
Special Nomination: In the figure, A
the straight line DE is parallel to the A
side BC of the triangle ABC. DE
intersects AB and AC (figure-1) or their D E
produced sections (figure-2) at D and FE B C
respectively. It is required to prove that
AD: DB = AE: EC Bo cb E
Drawing: Join B, E and C, D. Figure 1 Figure 2
Proof:
Step 1. The heights of AADE and ABDE are equal.
NADE AD . Co. .
“ ABDE ~ DB [The bases of the triangles of equal height are
proportional |
Step 2. The heights of AADE and ADEC are equal
cL —— = = [The bases of the triangles of equal height are
proportional |
