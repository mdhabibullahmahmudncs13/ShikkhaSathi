Example 29. The area of the whole surface of a cube is 96 square metre.
Determine the length of its diagonal.
Solution: Let, the sides of the cube is a.
The area of its whole surface = 6a? and length of its diagonal = v/3a
As per question, 6a” = 96 or, a> = 16 ".a = 4
.-. The length of the diagonal = v/3 - 4 = 6.928 metre (approx. ).
The required length of the diagonal 6.928 metre (approx.).
‘Work: The sides of 3 metal cubes are 3 cm, 4 cm and 5 cm respectively.
A new cube is formed by melting these 3 cubes. Determine the area of the
whole surface and the length of the diagonal of the new cube.
