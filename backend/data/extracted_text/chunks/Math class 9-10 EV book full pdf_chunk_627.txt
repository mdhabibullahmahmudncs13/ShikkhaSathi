========================================

Sequence
Let us note the following relation:
1 2 3 4 cee n cee
1 1 4 1 1
2 4 6 3 A
Here, every natural number n is related to twice the number 2n. That means, the
set of positive even numbers {2,4,6,---} is obtained by a method from the set pS
of natural numbers {1,2,3,---}. This arranged set of even number is a sequence. 5
