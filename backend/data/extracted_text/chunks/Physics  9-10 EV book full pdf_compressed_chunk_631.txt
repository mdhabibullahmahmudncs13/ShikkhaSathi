Reflection of Light 229

So you can see that the outside part of a spoon works as a convex mirror and the

inside of a spoon works as a concave mirror! A real concave mirror is actually a

part of a sphere. In the case of a convex mirror light was reflected from the

outside convex shape and in the case of a concave mirror light will be reflected

from the inside concave shape. focal

If parallel rays are incident on a concave f Inatl ;

mirror the light rays will converge at a ant Fi =

point after reflection (Figure 8.21). You i i

can understand that this point is the focal i n
