========================================

video camera, communication satellite would never be possible without the use
of integrated circuits.
13.2.4 Electronics of Future
The technology of electronics is still advancing, and in the future we will
experience electronic circuits using optics or light in an information
communicative integrated circuit. At the same time we will observe the use of
programmable IC (FPGA: Field Programmable Gate Array) in different fields in
accordance to our own needs.
13.3 Analog and Digital Electronics
Things that are happening around us every moment, like sound, light, pressure,
temperature are expressed as information or data. Their values can be changed
continuously. We might need these values in our different works, so we preserve
