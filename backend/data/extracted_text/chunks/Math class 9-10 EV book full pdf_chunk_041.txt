========================================

In order to add or subtract repeating decimal fractions, we need to convert
repeating decimal fractions into similar repeating decimals. Then addition or
subtraction must be carried out as in case of finite decimal fractions. If addition
or subtraction of finite and repeating decimal fractions together are done, in
order to make repeating decimal factions similar, the number of digits of
non—repeating part of each repeating fraction should be equal to the number of
digits between the numbers of digits after the decimal points of finite decimal
fractions and that of the non-repeating parts of repeating decimal fraction. The
number of digits of repeating part will be equal to L.C.M. as obtained by
applying the rules and in case of finite decimal fractions, necessary numbers of
