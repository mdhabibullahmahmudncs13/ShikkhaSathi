Procedure:
1. Taking a plank or a bench or a table, measure its length (L) by a ruler or
meter scale. This distance will be the distance travelled by the object.
2. By placing a book under one end of the plane plank or bench or table let
us make it inclined. Measure the height (h) of that end Dividing height
by length, find the slope (sin =h/L).
3. Put a marble or a pencil or a pen on the inclined plane and make sure
that it can roll.
4. You have to measure the time taken by the marble to travel the length of
the inclined plane. A stop watch is needed to measure the time accurately.
But it is unlikely to have a stop watch available. (Now a days stop watch
option is available in many mobile phones. You use the method given
