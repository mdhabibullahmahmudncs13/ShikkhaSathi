========================================

Objective: To create charges from friction and induction

Apparatus: Comb, aluminium foil.

Theory: While combing hair in winter, negative charges get stored in

the comb.

Working Procedure:

1) Take a very small piece of aluminium foil and roll it into a ball.

2) After combing the hair, bring the comb close to the aluminium foil

ball. If enough negative charges are accumulated on the comb, it will

induce a positive charge at the front side of the ball. (Since aluminium

foil is a conductor, the electrons in front will easily move back.) The

front side will be attracted by the comb and the ball will jump and

stick to the comb. 8
