Refraction of light 253
In order to illustrate this easily only three layers are shown. The density of the
air in upper level is high and so the refractive index is high. Air in the lower level
is heated, so density is low and its refractive index is also low. During refraction
of light from the tree, in each layer the angle of refraction will increase and at the
lowest level total internal reflection may happen. When entering a medium of
lower refractive index from a medium of higher refractive index there is a
possibility of crossing the critical angle because the angle of incidence is higher
if it is seen from far. So a mirage is seen from far and cannot be seen from near.
If a person looks at a tree from far away, he can see the tree directly, and due to
