Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 41
={(2,2),(2,4),(2,6),(3,2), (3,4), (3,6), (5,2), (5,4), (5,6)}
N{(3,2).(3.4),(3,6),(5,2). (5,4), (5,6) }
= {(3.2),(3,4), (3,6), (5,2), (5,4), (5. 6)} ------ (4)
Therefore, comparing (3) and (4) we get,
(ANC) x B= (Ax B)n(C x B)
Example 25. Let A={4,5,6,7}, B={0,1,2.3} and R= {(z,y): x € A,y €
Aandy =a +1}
1) Prove that, sets A and B are mutually disjoint.
2) Determine P(B) to show that number of elements of P(B) is 2", where n is
the number of elements of B.
3) Express the relation R in tabular method and determine its domain.
Solution:
1) Given, A ={4,5,6,7} and B ={0,1,2,3}
So ANB={4,56,71n{0,1,2.3} =o
Since ANB =@
Therefore, A and B are mutually disjoint .
2) Given,
B={0,1,2,3}
