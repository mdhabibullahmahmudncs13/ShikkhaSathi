========================================

(6-4 m/s ,

a= Gos - 2m/s

For any other time if we calculate the acceleration, the same value will be
found. It is shown in the acceleration- time graph in figure 2.09.

Therefore, you have seen that we have found velocity or acceleration
at any time starting from the distance- time graph. To more accurately
we draw this graph, the more precisely we calculate those quantities.
Now, use the second set to calculate velocity and acceleration from
graph.
