========================================

38. Two brothers had a trained horse which can follow any order. Getting out
from the house at the same time two brothers wanted to go to a Baishakhi
fair which is 20 miles away from their house. The hourse can carry only one
brother at any moment. If the speed of each brother is 4 miles per hour and
speed of the horse (with or without person) is 10 miles per hour, then what
is the minimum time they need to reach the fair? How much distance each
brother has to walk?
