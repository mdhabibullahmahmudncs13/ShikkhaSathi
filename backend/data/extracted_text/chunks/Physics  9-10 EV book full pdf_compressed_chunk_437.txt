========================================

understand Hooke’s law. According to this law, ‘within elastic limits stress

is directly proportional to strain’.

stress o strain
Therefore,
Stress = constant x Strain.
That is, there is a constant relating stress to strain for each material; the name of
this constant is modulus of elasticity.
It will be easy to understand if we discuss two things:
i) Let us suppose that the length of a wire of cross-sectional area Ais , ,
a body of weight 7 is hanged from it and due to this hanged force the wire is
elongated from LZ, to L (Figure 5.11). This elongated length creates a counter
force T in the wire (Here the letter 7 is used to mean the word ‘tension’.
Generally, when a wire is pulled then the force acting in it is named as tension).
.. Therefore Stress is 7/4 and strainis L — Lo
