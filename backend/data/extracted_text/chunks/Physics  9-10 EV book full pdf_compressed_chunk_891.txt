force.
12.2.4 D.C Motor
You know that a magnet can be used to apply force on another magnet. In other
words, we can say a magnetic field can be used to apply force on another
magnetic field. Since a wire cannot carry very much current, it cannot produce a
strong magnetic field. That is why with the help of another magnetic field a
strong force cannot be applied on it. You have seen that if a coil of wire is made
winding many times and a piece of iron or armature is inserted into it, then by
passing a little amount of current through the wire, the coil becomes a strong
electromagnet that can create a very strong magnetic field. If we imagine the coil
is to be a bar magnet, and keep it in another magnetic field, then we can analyze
