========================================

resistance. The ¥ which we are discussing here is not the potential difference
between the two sides of the wire. It is the value of potential of the electric wire!
The value of the potential on two sides of the electrical wire is almost equal. So
the difference is negligible.
11.4.1 System Loss of Electricity
We know that the power plants situated at different parts of the country produce
electricity. This electricity is to be transmitted to different of the country. To
distribute electricity, first it is transmitted to the substations of different areas.
The electrical energy is then distributed to consumers using electricity 3
distribution systems. h
