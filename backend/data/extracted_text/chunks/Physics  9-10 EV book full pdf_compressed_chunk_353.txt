========================================

energy, then this energy is E, and its amount is £ = mc?, here c is the light
velocity. The velocity of light (3x10% m/s) is huge, if it is squared it becomes
huge also, it means if we can transform a little mass into energy, we will get a
huge amount of energy, in a nuclear power plant just this thing is done.
In a nuclear power plant, one of the fuels that are used is uranium 235. Here
there are 92 protons and 143 neutrons. Its amount in nature is very small, only
0.7%, its half life is 703,800,000 (704 million) years. A uranium 235 nucleus can
capture another neutron very easily (if the speed of that neutron is small). Then
the uranium 235 nucleus becomes very unstable, then it is divided into two small
nuclei Kr”? and Ba'*'. In addition to this, three more neutrons come out
