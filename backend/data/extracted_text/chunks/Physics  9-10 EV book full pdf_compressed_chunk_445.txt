State of Matter and Pressure 153
Gas : Molecular properties Reflection in gases
. Spread through the total volume of the
Molecules can move beside one another P . ue Lo VY u
container in which it is kept.
Distance among the molecules is | Gas can be compressed by pressure
more, there exists vacant space
A molecule can move with respect to | Gas can flow easily
another
Liquid: Molecular properties Reflection in liquids
Molecules can move beside one Can flow easily, gain the shape of the
another container in which it is kept.
Molecules are very close together | Liquid cannot be compressed by
so there is no vacant space applying pressure
Solid : Molecular properties Reflection in solids
Molecules are rigid in their own There is a definite shape
position
