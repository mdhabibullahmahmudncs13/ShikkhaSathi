Refraction of light 255
0, = sin~! (ie) = sin~1(0.97) = 75°

Therefore light has to incident at an angle of 75° or more.

9.3.2 Periscope and binocular

There is something called periscope

in submarines and it is possible to see

above the water surface while under ¥ i

water by periscope. The periscope is {

made by a prism and its total internal

reflection is more effective than a periscope

made of ordinary mirrors (Figure

9.12). In order to reduce the length of

binoculars, total internal reflection is i NR

done using prisms in it. NJ 0 on
