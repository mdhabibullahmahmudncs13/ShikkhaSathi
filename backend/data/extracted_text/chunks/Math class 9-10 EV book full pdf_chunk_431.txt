========================================

perpendicular bisector of chord AB and GH is the A B
perpendicular bisector of chord BC. But both EF x
and GH pass through the centre and their common
point is O. Therefore, the point O is the centre of
the circle or of the arc of the circle.
Tangents to a Circle
‘We have known that a tangent can not be drawn to a circle from a point internal
to it. If the point is on the circle, a single tangent can be drawn at that point. The
tangent is perpendicular to the radius drawn from the specified point. Therefore,
in order to construct a tangent to a circle at a point on it, it is required to construct
the radius from the point and then construct a perpendicular to it. Again, if the
point is located outside the circle, two tangents to the circle can be constructed.
