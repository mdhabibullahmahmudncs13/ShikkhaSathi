========================================

your palm is A then the pressure
p= F
TA
. oN
Unit of pressure: —= or Pa (Pascal)
Dimension of pressure [P] = ML™'T 2
Therefore, in the second case because of using two hands, the pressure will be
half as the area through which the force is being applied is doubled. In the third
case, you applied force through your whole body, so the area through which
force is applied will increase more and pressure will be decreased more.
Force is a vector, so you may think that pressure P is a vector! But the interesting
matter is pressure P is a scalar quantity and if we want to write it perfectly then
it should be written like as:
F=PA
