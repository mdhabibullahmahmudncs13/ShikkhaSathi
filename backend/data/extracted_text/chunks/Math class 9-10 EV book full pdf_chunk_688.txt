========================================

the sides adjacent to the equal angles are proportional, the triangles are similar.
AB AC
ial Nomination: Let in AABC and ADEF, ZA = /D and —— = —.
Special Nomination: Let in Can R an DE = DF
It is to be proved that, AABC and ADEF are similar.
A D
Ae LN
E F
B C
Drawing: Consider the matching sides of ABC and DEF unequal. Take two
points P and Q on AB and AC respectively so that AP = DE and AQ = DF.
Join P and Q.
