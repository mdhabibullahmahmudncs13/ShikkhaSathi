========================================

SAD || CF

Again, BD = AD = CF and BD || CF

Therefore BDF C' is a parallelogram.

DF || BC or, DE || BC.
Step 2. Again, DF = BC or, DE + EF = BC'

or, DE+ DE = BC or, 2DE = BC or, DE = 5BC

DE || BC and DE = 38C (Proved).
Theorem 15. (Pythagoras theorem)
In a right-angled triangle the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the
squares of regions on the two other sides. A
Let in the triangle ABC, ZABC' = 1 right angle and
AC is the hypotenuse. Then, AC? = AB? + BC?
