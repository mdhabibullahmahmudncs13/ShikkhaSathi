5. Area of trapezium region: Two parallel sides of
trapezium region and the distance of perpendicular
between them are given. Let ABCD be a trapezium
whose lengths of parallel sides are AB = a unit, « _,
CD = b unit and distance between them be CE = ¢
AF = h. Diagonal AC divides the trapezium region
ABCD into AABC and AACD.
Area of trapezium region ABCD
= area of AABC + area of AACD Al EP
