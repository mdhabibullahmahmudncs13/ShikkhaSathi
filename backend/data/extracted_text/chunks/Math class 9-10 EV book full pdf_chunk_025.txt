========================================

1.3 is a pure repeating fraction and 4.235112 is a mixed repeating fraction.
If in the denominator there are digits other than 2, 5 as a factor, then no
numerator will be divisible by that denominator. Since there cannot be any digit
other than 1, 2, ..., 9 at some stage as residue, the same numbers will appear.
Number of digits in the repeating part is always less than the number in the
denominator.

11, 0 has been placed in the 74
dividend and a 0 has been 210
placed to the right of 3 and made it 30 185
