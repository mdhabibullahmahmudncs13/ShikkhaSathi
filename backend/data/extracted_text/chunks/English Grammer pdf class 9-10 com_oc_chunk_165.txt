Form
May and might are modal verbs and are used, like auxiliary verbs, to express
different meanings of the main verb.
In a positive sentence, we use may/might + verb
For negatives, we use may not/might not + verb
Note: May/ might are not usually used in a question form to mean
possibility.
We can use may in a question to express asking for or giving
permission. For example,
May | sit here? Yes, you may. May | see that book? No, you may not.
However, this sounds very formal in everyday situations now, and
can/could are used more frequently.
We use may/might to refer to the present or future time:
It may rain this evening.
The shoes might be too small for you.
He may be in his office now.
