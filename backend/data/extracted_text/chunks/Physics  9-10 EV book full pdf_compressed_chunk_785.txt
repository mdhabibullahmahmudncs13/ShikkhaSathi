========================================

shockwave. The sound of a thunderbolt is a kind of shockwave. Although the
flashing of light and sound are created at the same time, we see the light first,
since the speed of light is so much that it reaches us within the next moment. The
speed of sound is 330 m/s which means it takes 3 s for it to travel one kilometer.
That is why; we can guess the distance at which the lightning is created by
calculating how many seconds later we hear the sound of thunder. Roughly
3 seconds for a kilometer.
Since electric current flows down from the clouds during a lightning, it usually
strikes tall structures. So to protect tall buildings from thunderbolts, more than
one pointy metal needle is set up on the roof. This current is then transferred to
