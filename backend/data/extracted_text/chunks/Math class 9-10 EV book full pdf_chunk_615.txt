Example 15. How many times will minute hand and hour hand coincide? Find
the times.

Solution: Let minute hand and hour hand coincide at the time z : y. We need
to remember that z (x = 0,1,--- 11 where 0 means 12) is always an integer but y
may not be. We know, minute hand runs 12 times faster than the hour hand. At
time x the hour hand is exactly on the x and minute hand is on the 12. Within
y minutes the hour hand passes 2 and the minute hand passes y ticks. So,
