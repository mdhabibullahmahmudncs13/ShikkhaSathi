Sets and Functions
The term "set” is well known to us. For example, dinner set, set of natural numbers,
set of rational numbers etc. As a modern concept set has versatile use. The
German mathematician George Cantor (1845-1918) first explained the concept of
set. He introduced the notion of infinite set, and created a sensation in mathematical
science. His notion is now known as set theory. In this chapter we shall solve
different problems by using concepts of set, diagrams and logic and idea of a
function will also be introduced.
After completion of this chapter the learners will be able to —

» express the concepts of sets and subsets through symbols.

» describe how sets can be expressed.
