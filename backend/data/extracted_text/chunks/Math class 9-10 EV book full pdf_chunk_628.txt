Hence, some quantities are arranged in a particular way such that the antecedent
and subsequent terms becomes related. The set of quantities arranged in such a
way is called a sequence.
The aforesaid relation is called a function and written as f(n) = 2n. The general
term of this sequence is 2n. The number of terms of any sequence is infinite. The
way of writing the sequence with the help of general term is:
{2n}, n=1,2,3,-- or, {2n};2] or, {2n}
The first quantity of the sequence is called the first term, the second quantity is
called second term, the third quantity is called the third term etc. The first term
of the sequence 1,3,5,7,-- is 1, the second term is 2, etc. Followings are the four
