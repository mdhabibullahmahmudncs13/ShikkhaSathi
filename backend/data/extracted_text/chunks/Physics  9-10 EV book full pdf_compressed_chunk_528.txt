========================================

decrease.
That is,
The heat supplied: m,s(30° C—T)
These two types of heat must be equal. Hence:
myL + mysT =mys(30°C —T)
I= 30°C x mys —myL
- (my +mg)s

Question: What is the final temperature if 1 liter of water temperature 20 °C is added
to 2 liter water at temperature 75 °C?
Answer: Let us consider the final temperature is T, so the temperature of 2 liter of
water reaches T by decreasing the temperature from 75 °C. Absorbing this amount of
heat the temperature of 2 liter water reaches T by increasing the temperature from
20°C.
Hence
Mass of 1 liter water my = 1kg
Mass of 2 liter water m, = 2 kg
«Specific heat of water s = 4.2 10° Jkg'K?
