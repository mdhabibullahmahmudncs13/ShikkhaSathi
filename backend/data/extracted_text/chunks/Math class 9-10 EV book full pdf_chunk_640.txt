Example 6. Rashid deposits Tk. 1200 from his salary in the first month and
every subsequent month, he deposits Tk. 100 more than the previous month.
1) Express the aforesaid problem as a series upto n terms.
2) How much does he deposit in the 18 th month and how much does he deposit
in first 18 months?
3) In how many years does he deposit a total of Tk. 106200?
Solution:
1) As per the question, first term of the arithmetic series, a = 1200, common
difference d = 100
second term = 1200 + 100 = 1300
Third term = 1300 + 100 = 1400
n-th term = a + (n — 1)d =1200 4 (n — 1) 100=1100+100n
.. The series is 1200 4 1300 + 1400 + - - - + (1100+100n)
2) We know, n-th term =a + (n — 1)d
