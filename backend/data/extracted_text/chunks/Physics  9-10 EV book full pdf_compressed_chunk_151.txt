The three laws of falling bodies of Galileo are nothing but these equations of
motion of falling bodies.
The first law states that all objects released from the same height will reach the
ground at the same time i.e. it does not depend on the mass of the objects. This
does not go with the experience of our daily lives. If a piece of paper and a piece
of stone are released from the same height, at the same time, then the stone reaches
the ground first and the paper reaches the ground later. This happens due to the
resistance of air. If the experiment is done in a vacuum tube then both the paper
and stone will reach the ground at the same time. Galileo's first law can be
understood from the equation of falling bodies. This is because there is no mass of
