========================================

becomes less, that water goes up and the cold water in the neighborhood comes
down. After some time this water also becomes heated and goes up and so within
a short period of time the water starts to boil. (The process of heating gas or
liquid in this way is called convection.) If density of water was not reduced after
heating, then it would not go up and we could only heat the water in the lower
part of the pot, by fire of the stove, and it would not be possible to heat the whole
water of the pot.
In intense sunshine in summer, those who have jumped into a pond have surely
noticed that though the surface water is hot but the bottom water is cold. Here
the heat comes from above and after heating, the top water density decreases and
