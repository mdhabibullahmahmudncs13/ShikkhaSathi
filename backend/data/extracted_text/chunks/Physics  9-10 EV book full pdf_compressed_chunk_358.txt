4.7 Power
The term "power is used a lot of times in our daily lives, and it is not that the
term is always used in a positive sense! But the word ‘power’ has a definite
meaning in physics; power is the rate of doing work. That is, if work # is done
in time t, then power P is:

w

p=—

t
We have seen before that work is nothing but transformation of energy. As
energy can’t be destroyed, so it is only being transformed by doing work. So we
can say, if we desire, power is the rate of transformation of energy. As work or
energy is a scalar quantity, then power is also a scalar quantity.
We have known about different quantities, their units, and tried to know their
dimensions in every case while learning physics. Unit and dimension of power
are:
