Simple Harmonic Motion
Simple harmonic motion is a special type of periodic motion. In case of
oscillatory motion the object oscillates on both sides of a definite point. This
specific point is called the equilibrium point. At the extreme ends of its path, the
particle's velocity is zero. As the particle moves from one end toward the equi-
librium point, its velocity gradually increases, reaching a maximum at the equi-
librium point. As it continues toward the opposite end, its velocity decreases
gradually untilitagain becomes zero. The particle then reverses direction, moving
back in the same manner until it reaches the original end and briefly stops. This
entire process takes one period. This pattern of the motion gets repeated
