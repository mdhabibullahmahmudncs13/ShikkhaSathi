========================================

relation is converted into an equation.
Therefore, we can write Newton's second law of motion as an equation. If the
force is F and the proportionality constant is considered as 1, then
That this small and simple equation can make a revolutionary change in the
world of physics is difficult to believe.
Unit of force is Newton (N).
Dimension of force is [F] = MLT?
