========================================

there is charge-less neutrons with protons in the nucleus, and nuclei become
stable due to very strong nuclear force between neutrons and protons. Though
there is only one proton at the center of a normal hydrogen atom, there are also
hydrogen nuclei with one or two neutrons.
With the increase of the number of protons, to keep this nucleus stable, the
number of neutrons also increases. But when the proton number exceeds 82,
the nucleus starts to become unstable. But, no stable isotope is found for
Technetium (43) and Promethium (61).These unstable nuclei try to become stable
by emitting a kind of radiation. We call this process radioactivity. The radiation
that comes out from the nucleus is called a radioactive ray.
