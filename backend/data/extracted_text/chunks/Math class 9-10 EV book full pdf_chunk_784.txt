‘Work: Circumference of a circle is 440 metre. Determine the length of the sides]

of the inscribed square in it.
Example 22. The radius of a circle is 12 cm and the length of an arc is 14
cm. Determine the angle subtended by the circular segment at its centre.
Solution: Let, radius of the circle is 7 = 12 em, the length of the arc is s = 14
cm and the angle subtended at the centre is 6.

rl
We know, s = 180
or, rf = 180 x s
180 x 5 180 x 14

= —— = ——— = (6.84° .
or ar 3.1416 x 12 (approx)
The required angle is 66.84° (approx. )
