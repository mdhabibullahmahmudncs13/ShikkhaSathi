Chapter 8. Circle 175
Theorem 24. If two opposite angles of a quadrilateral are supplementary, the
four vertices of the quadrilateral are concyclic.

Let ABCD be the quadrilateral with ZABC +

ZADC = 2 right angles. It is required to prove that gD

the four points A, B, C', D are concyclic.

Drawing: Since the points A, B, C are not A c
collinear, there exists a unique circle which passes

through these three points. Let the circle intersect B

AD at E. Join C, E.

Proof: ABCE is a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle.

Therefore, ZABC + ZAEC = 2 right angles. [The sum of the two opposite angles
of an inscribed quadrilateral is two right angles.]

But ZABC + ZADC = 2 right angles. [given]
