========================================

and makes angle ZACB = 45° with the ground.
. AB
From AABC we get, sin/ACB = ac
h
sin 45° = —
or, sin 45 IT
Or 1 h in 45° 1 A
or, — = — |" sin 45° = —
Vis RE
or, V2h =18 or, h = — 18m
V2 h
18v/2
or, h = 12 [multiplying the numerator and A J
denominator by V2) c B
or, h = 12.728 (approx.)
Therefore, The required height of the wall is 12.73 (approx.)
Example 4. A tree leaned due to storm. The stick with height of 7 metre from
its foot was leaned against the tree to make it straight. If the angle of depression
at the point of contacting with the stick on the ground is 30°, find the length of the pS
stick. S
