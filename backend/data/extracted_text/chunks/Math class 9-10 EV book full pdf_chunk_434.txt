Construction 8. To draw a tangent to a circle from a point outside.
Let P be a point outside of a circle whose centre is
O. A tangent is to be drawn to the circle from the
point P. A
Drawing: p=
1. Join P,O. The middle point M of the line 7
segment PO is determined. P
2. Now with M as centre and MO as radius, a J
circle is drawn. Let the new circle intersect the |
given circle at the points A and B. B
3. Join A, P and B, P.
Then both AP, BP are the required tangents.
Proof: A, O and B, O are joined. PO is the diameter of the circle APB.
:. ZPAO = 1 right angle ['.- the angle inscribed in the semi-circle is a right
angle]
So the line segment OA is perpendicular to AP. Therefore, the line segment AP
