========================================

are sequentially equal to the angles of the square (all right angles). Though the
similar angles of the figure are equal, the ratios of the matching sides are not the
same. Hence the figures are not similar. In case of triangles, situation like this
does not arise. As a result of matching the vertices of triangles, if one of the
conditions of similarity is true, the other condition automatically becomes true
and the triangles are similar. That is, two similar triangles are always equiangular
and two equiangular triangles are always similar.
If two triangles are equiangular and one of their matching pairs is equal, the
triangles are congruent. The ratio of the matching sides of two equiangular
triangles is a constant. Proofs of the related theorems are given below.
