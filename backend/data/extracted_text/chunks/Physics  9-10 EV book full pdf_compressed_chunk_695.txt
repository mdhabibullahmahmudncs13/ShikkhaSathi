========================================

cannot move towards the main ray. Though in a prism the direction of light

changes, it is important for another reason. After entering the prism, how much

the ray of light will deviates from the main direction depends on the refractive

index of the prism. We know that the refractive index depends on the wavelength

or the color of light. So there is a different refractive index for different colors.

Therefore, if there exists different colors in the same ray of light, when passing

through a prism the ray of light of each color will change its direction in different
I. angles. Therefore we will see that when coming out from the prism the light is
H separated into its component colors. This was first shown by Newton.
