Reflection of Light 231
concave mirror perpendicularly and after reflection will go back the way it has
come. As shown in figure, another ray from point X can be a ray parallel to the
principal axis. Because we have already known that parallel ray goes through the
focal point after reflection. So it will be incident on the point Q and after
reflection will go through the point F.

Figure 8.22: Image appears larger than the object in the
concave mirror placed inside the focal length.
After emerging from point X two rays of light will travel towards NO and QF
and we can see that these two rays have no chance of intersecting. So there
cannot be an image formed on the right side. But if we are able to look at the left
