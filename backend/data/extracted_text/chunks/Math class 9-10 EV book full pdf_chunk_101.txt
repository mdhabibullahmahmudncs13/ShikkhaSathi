========================================

Solution: Given, R={(z.y):x€ A,ye A y=a+1}

From the conditions of R we get y = + 1.

Now for each x € A determine the value of y = = + 1.

Since 4 ¢ A, (3,4) ¢ BR = {(0,1), (1,2). (2,3)}

‘Work:
1) If § = {(-3,8),(-2.,3),(~1,0),(0,-1),(1,0),(2,3)}, then determine
domain and range of S.
2) Let S={(z,y):2.,y € Aand y — x = 1}, where A = {-3,-2,—1,0}.
Determine Dom S and Range S.

Graph of a Function

Visual display of a function is said to be graph. In order to clarify the concept

of a function significance of graph is important. French philosopher and

mathematician Rene Descartes (1596-1650) was the first to play pioneering role

in introducing relations between algebra and geometry. He introduced a modern
