========================================

APB and is inscribed in the conjugate arc ACB.

It is to be noted that, APB and ACB are mutually

conjugate.

Remarks: The angle inscribed in an arc of a circle is the angle with vertex in

the arc and the sides passing through the terminal points of the arc. An angle

standing on an arc is the angle inscribed in the conjugate arc.

Angle at the Centre (Central angle)

The angle with vertex at the centre of the circle is

called an angle at the centre. An angle at the centre

cuts an arc of the circle and is said to stand on the

arc. In the adjacent figure, ZAOB is an angle at the

centre and it stands on the arc APB. Every angle A

at the centre stands on a minor arc of the circle. In 7 B

the figure APB is the minor arc. So the vertex of an A
