========================================

In air, velocity of sound is proportional to the in different medium
square root of temperature. i.e.
>
Here the temperature is not Celsius temperature. Hydrogen| 1281 |
Temperature in the Kelvin scale.
The velocity of sound does not depend on the air
pressure. But it is inversely proportional to the
square root of the density of air. So if there is water
vapor in the air, its density decreases, hence velocity increases.
Sound is a mechanical wave. It depends on the elasticity of the medium. The
nature of liquid and solid is different from air and naturally the velocity of sound
is different there. In liquid the velocity of sound is more than that in air and in
solid velocity of sound is even more than in liquid.
