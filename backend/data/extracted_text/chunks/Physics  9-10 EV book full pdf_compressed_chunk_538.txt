1. The distance between two electric poles is 30 m. A copper wire with a length
0f 30.001 m was connected to those two pillars on a day when the temperature
was 30°C. The coefficient of linear expansion of copper is 1.67 10K". The
wire snapped on a winter day when the temperature of the air was 4° C.

(a) Define triple point of water.

(b) If two bodies have equal amounts of heat, can they be at different
temperatures? Explain.

(c) Express the temperature of air in Fahrenheit scale.

(d) Explain the cause for the wire to snap with mathematical logic.
