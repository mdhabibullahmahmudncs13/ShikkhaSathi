Trigonometry. The word “Trigonometry” is derived from Greek words ‘tri’ (means
three), ‘gon’ (means edge) and ‘metron’ (means measure). In fact, trigonometry
is the study of relationship between the sides and angles of a triangle. There are
evidence of using the Trigonometry in Egyptian and Babilonian civilization. It is
believed that the Egyptians made its extensive use in land survey and engineering
works. Early astrologers used it to determine the distances from the Earth to
the farthest planets and stars. At present trigonometry is in use in all branches
of mathematics. There are wide used of trigonometry for the solution of triangle
related problems and in navigation etc. Now a days trigonometry is in wide use
in Astronomy and Calculus.
