Solution: Voltage at D is zero
Voltage at A is 6V

What may be the voltage at E, how can it be determined, many of us may be
confused about this. Actually the case is very simple. When current flows
through a resistance, the voltage changes. There is no chance of current flow in
this part BE of the circuit. It can go nowhere after reaching E starting from B.
So, the voltage at B and E (and any point between them) does not change, the
voltage at B remains the same at E.
To determine the voltages of B and E, the current has to be determined. If
current is I, then i v_ 6V 1 \

TR O5Q+10Q+15Q 5
So, voltage difference from A to B, 1
