(a) The Area of Trapezium Region
ABCD is a trapezium. Where AB || CD, AB = a, CD = b and perpendicular
distance = A. Construct DA | CE at C.
~. AECD is a parallelogram. From the figure,
area of trapezium = area of parallelogram AECD + area of triangle CEB
! D b C
= bxh+—(a=b)xh
1
= —(a+b)xh A
F@+b) LE 5
Area of trapezium region = average of the sum of two parallel sides x height
Activity :
1. Find the area of trapezium region by an alternative method.
(b) The Area of Rhombus
The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. If we know
the lengths of two diagonals, we can find the area of rhombus.
Let the diagonals AC and BD of a rhombus ABCD intersect each other
at O. Denote the lengths of two diagonals by « and b respectively.
