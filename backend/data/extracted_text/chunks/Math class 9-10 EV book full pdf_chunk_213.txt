Example 8. Find the value of x: 1) log gz = —2 2) log,324 = 4
Solution:
1) logx = —2
or,r=10"2= = = — =0.01
cox =0.01
2) log,324 = 4
or, 7 =324=3x3x3x3x2x2=3"x2%
or, xt = 3% x (v2)!
or, t= (3v/2)!
cr =3V2
Example 9. Prove that, 3log,(2 + log,,5 = log,,40
Solution: Left hand side = 3log,,2 + log,,5
= log;y2° + logy, [ log, M" = rlog,M]|
= log;(8 + log;(5
= log,((8 x 5) [. log, (MN) = log, M + log,N]|
= log,(40 = right hand side (proved)
Example 10. Simplify: 0819/27 + 10108 — logy v/ 1000 Te logyv/1000
Solution: logo v/27 + logiy8 — logy v'1000 + logy8 — logy 1000
