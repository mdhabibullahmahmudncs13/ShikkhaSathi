5. Isosceles triangle: Let ABC be an isosceles
triangle in which
AB =AC=aand BC =) b
Draw AD L BC... BD = CD = 5 A
AABD is right angled.

Example 1. The lengths of the two sides of a right -angled triangle, adjacent to
right angle are 6 cm and 8 cm respectively. Find the area of the triangle.
Solution: Let, the sides adjacent to right angle are a = 8
1
cm and b = 6 cm respectively... Its area = 50 = 6cm
1
3 x 6 x 8 square cm = 24 square cm
8 cm
Example 2. The lengths of the two sides of a triangle are 9 cm and 10 cm
respectively and the angle included between them is 60°. Find the area.
