Line, Ray, Line Segment
By postulates of plane geometry, every point of a straight line lies in a plane. Let
AB be a line in a plane and C be a point on it. The point C' is called internal to A
and B if the points A, C' and B are different points on a line and AC'+CB = AB.
The points A, C and B are also called collinear points. The set of points including
A and B and all the internal points is known as the line segment AB. The points
between A and B are called internal points.

Angle
When two rays in a plane meet at a point, an angle
is formed. The rays are known as the sides of the
