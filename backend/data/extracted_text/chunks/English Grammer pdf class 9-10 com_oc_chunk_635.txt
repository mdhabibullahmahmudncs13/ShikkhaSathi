Women started off reading more books than men, but their numbers followed
a different pattern. Between 2011 and 2012, there was an increase from 3000
to 3500 in 2012, and 8000 in 2015. Then there was a gradual rise to 10000
books in 2013. However, in 2014, the numbers fell back to 8000 again.
Overall, there was a strong upward trend in the number of books read by men.
Although women read more books than men from 2011 to 2013, their reading
fell to below the level of men in 2014.
