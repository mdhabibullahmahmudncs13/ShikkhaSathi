Remainder Theorem
In the following example, if 62% — 72 +5 is divided by x — 1,then what is quotient
and remainder?
z—1) 62° —Tx +5 (6r—1
62? —6x
—r +5
—z +1
4
Here, x — 1 is divisor, 62% — 7x + 5 is dividen,6x — 1 is quotient and 4 is
remainder.
We know, dividend = divisor x quotient + remainder
Now, if we indicate the dividend by f(x), the quotient by h(x), the remainder by
r and the divisor by (x — a), from the above formula, we get,
f(z) = (xz —a)- h(x) +r, this formula is true to all values of a.
Substituting = = a in both sides we get,
fla)=(a—a) h(a) +r =0-h(a)+r=r
Hence, r = f(a)
Therefore, if f(z) is divided by (z — a), the remainder is f(a). This formula is
