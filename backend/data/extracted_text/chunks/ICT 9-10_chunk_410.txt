test input=int(input('Insert an integer number:'))

print('This is your integer number:', test_input)
Then, we will see the output as shown below:
Insert an integer number: 1245

Here, notice that when we print text inside the print() function, we write it within

- single quotes (''). However, when we print a variable, we write the name of the
variable directly without any quotes.
