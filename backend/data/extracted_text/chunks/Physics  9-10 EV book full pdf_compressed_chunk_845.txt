If electricity flows through a resistance for time ¢, then Pt energy is supplied there.
Where does this energy go? When you use a resistance in a circuit and if you
pass enough electricity through this resistance, then you will notice that it
always gets hot. That means the electrical energy evolves as heat energy.
The use of bulbs with filaments are getting scarce, because the filament has to be
heated to create light with this. A big part of the electric energy is used to heat up
the filament, and energy is wasted. If we touch these bulbs with our hand we can
feel how much heat energy is created, and this energy is created as °R or V*/R in
every second.
This is not the only place where the electrical energy is used to create heat ~<
