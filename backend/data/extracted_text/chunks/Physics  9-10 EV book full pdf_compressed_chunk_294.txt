Question: Your mass is 50 kg. You have climbed up a 10 storied building, how

much work have you done? (Height of each floor is 3 m)

Answer: If your mass is 50 kg, your weight is 50 x 9.8=490 N. This weight is a force,

that is acting downwards. If you want to climb up, you have to exert an equal

force upwards to draw yourself up.

So, upward applied force: 490 N

Distance travelled upwards: 10 x 3 m=30 m

So the amount of work done, 490 N x30 m =14700 J=14.7 kJ

Suppose, a moving object is coming towards you, you try to stop the object by

applying force F, the object pushes you backwards by a distance s. How much

work was done by the force applied by you? Certainly you have noticed that, this
