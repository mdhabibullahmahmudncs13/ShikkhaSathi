Figure 12.15: Magnetic field around a current carrying wire
3. By observing the Figure 12.15, in which direction is the current flowing in
each wire?
4. The number of turns in the primary coil of a transformer is 100, here by
applying 15 V AC in the primary, 150 V AC is obtained in the secondary coil. I]
What is the number of turns in the secondary coil? o
