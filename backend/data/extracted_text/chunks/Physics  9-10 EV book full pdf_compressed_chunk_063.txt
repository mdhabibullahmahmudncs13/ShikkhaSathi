========================================

eo The light coming from a single candle can be said one candela.

You see that none of them are perfect measurements, but easy to realize. If you

are habituated with this measurement, when in future you will calculate

anything, then you will have a sense of proportion about it.

1.5.2 Prefix

To study science or physics we have to measure different things. Sometimes we

need to measure the length of a galaxy (6x10* m), or sometimes we have to

measure the radius of the nucleus (1x10"* m). To measure this huge difference
in the distance it is not wise to use the same type of numbers. So internationally
some SI prefixes have been made. Due to this multiplier we will be able to
express a large or small number by a small prefix. These prefixes are shown in
