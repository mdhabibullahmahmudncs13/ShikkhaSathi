========================================

another medium. Then the refractive index may be less than 1 depending on
which medium is being compared with which.
For example, if water is the first medium and glass is the second medium (Figure
9.05) th
) then ny sind; = n, sin 6,
ny =133
n, = 1.52
The refractive index of glass compared to water:
v v/v. on sind,
Zo v/v. 2-21 _114
v w/v, Mm sind -
which is greater than 1. Here, v, means speed of light in vacuum. 8
