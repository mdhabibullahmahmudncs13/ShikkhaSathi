========================================

" .. factors of 28 are 1,2,4,7,14,28

a

BS Hence the desired set is B = {1,2,4,7,14, 28}

Example 3.Express C' = {x : x positive integer and x? < 18} by using roster
method.
Solution: 1,2,3,4,5,... are positive integers.
Here, if
x =1then 22 =12=1;if x =2then 2° =22=4
If 2 = 3,then 2? =3%=09;if x = 4 then 2° =4%=16
If x = 5, then 7? = 5% = 25 ; which is greater than 18.
.. as per conditions the acceptable positive integers are 1,2,3 and 4.
.-. the given set is C' = {1,2,3,4}
