========================================

mirror the light rays will converge at a ant Fi =

point after reflection (Figure 8.21). You i i

can understand that this point is the focal i n

point of the concave mirror and the i +

distance from the pole to this point is pole - =

known as the focal distance. Light rays Pr <

don’t have any option of stopping, so after —=

converging at a point they will travel or

straight forward and it will look like light is

diverging from that point! Therefore before

reaching the focal point the rays are Figure 8.21: The focal distance of a

converging (convergent) and after reaching concave mirror is half of the radius of the

the focal point the rays are diverging sphere

(divergent).

Example

Question: If we imagine a plane mirror as a spherical concave mirror, what will
