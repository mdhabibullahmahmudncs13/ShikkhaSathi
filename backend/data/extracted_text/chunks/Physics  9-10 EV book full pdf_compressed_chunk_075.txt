Vernier scale ~g

Main scale Fd
Figure 1.05: Main scale and movable vernier scale
If we keep the vernier scale in such a way that it does not start from a millimeter
mark rather it starts with a slight Ces mm) displacement (Figure 1.06) then the
number of = mm displacements by which it has moved will be the mark
of the vernier scale coinciding with the millimeter mark of the main scale! Therefore,
it is very easy to measure a length using a vernier scale. First of all, we have to know
the difference between one division of vernier scale and one division of the main
scale- this is called the vernier constant-- in brief VC. This can be calculated if we
divide the length of the smallest division (1 mm) of the main scale by the total
