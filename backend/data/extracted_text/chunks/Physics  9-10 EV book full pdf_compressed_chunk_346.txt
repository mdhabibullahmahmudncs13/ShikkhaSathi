========================================

If we consider from the viewpoint of quantity, the conversion of maximum
amount of energy undoubtedly takes place from the heat energy in the world.
Heat energy is transformed into mechanical energy in all engines of all
machines. In thermocouple ( applying heat at the junction of two different
metals), though there are examples of conversion of heat into electrical energy
directly, actually almost in all the cases heat energy is converted into mechanical
energy and then mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy. (To save
the environment we don't like the dissipation of energy now-a-days, so we use
energy saving bulbs more instead of using light bulbs where light is produced
due to heating) We see the transformation of heat energy into light energy from
