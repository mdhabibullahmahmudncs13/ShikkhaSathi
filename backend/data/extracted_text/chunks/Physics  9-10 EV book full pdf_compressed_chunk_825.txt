d a variable resistance or a Rheostat. A
fixed resistance has two ends, whereas a variable resistance has an additional
terminal in the middle, where the changed value of the resistance is obtained. It
is shown in Figure 11.06.
Example
Question: The specific resistances p of silver, copper, tungsten and nichrome
wire are 1.6x10%, 1.7x10%, 5.5x10%, 100x10* Q m respectively. Using a wire
of 1 m? cross sectional area, make a 1 Q resistance.
Answer:
‘We know, R= AL

where, L is the length and A4 is the cross-sectional area.
So,

For Silver, ° ° °
