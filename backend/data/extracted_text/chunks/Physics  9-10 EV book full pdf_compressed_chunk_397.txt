State of Matter and Pressure 135
Density can be increased by compressing air or gas by increasing pressure but same
is not true for liquids (neither for solids !). Liquids cannot be compressed in the
same way with pressure, so its density cannot be increased or decreased. How
pressure of water is increases when we go from the surface to the bottom of a sea
is shown in figure 5.03. Since the density of water is nearly uniform, the
pressure is increasing at the same rate. Starting from zero at the surface of the
sea, it is increased a lot at the bottom of the sea.
