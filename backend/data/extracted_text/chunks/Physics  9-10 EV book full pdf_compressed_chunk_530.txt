6.7 Effect of Pressure on Melting Point and Boiling Point

If pressure is applied on a substance, its melting point goes down, for this reason

when pressure is applied, two pieces of ice unite together to form a single piece.

Where pressure is applied on an ice, the melting point decreases there and the ice

melts, after the removal of pressure the melting point again goes back to the previous

value. As a result the water obtained from the fusion of ice again freezes into ice.

Attaching two masses to the ends of a string, if it is placed upon the surface of an ice

bar so that the masses are hanging at the two ends; it will seem that the string has cut

the ice bar into two pieces. But examining the ice we will see that the ice is still a

single piece (Figure 6.09). -
