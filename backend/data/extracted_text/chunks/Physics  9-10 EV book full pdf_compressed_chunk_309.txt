Since the direction of applied force and ging and compressed by applied
the distance traversed is in the same force
direction, so the work done is positive. According to the definition of work, here
energy is to be created. But where is that energy? Here nothing is in motion, so
definitely there is no kinetic energy.
Those of us who have used springs can guess that energy is definitely hidden in
the compressed spring. Because if an object of mass m is kept before the
compressed spring and then released, the spring would exert a force on it and
