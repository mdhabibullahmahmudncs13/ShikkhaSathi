State of Matter and Pressure 141
Applications of Pascal’s Law:
Using Pascal’s law some interesting machines can be fabricated. In figure 5.05 a
machine like that is shown. Here two cylinders are connected by a pipe. Let’s
suppose cross sectional area of one cylinder is 4, and that of another cylinder 4,
, and you have applied force /7, on the cylinder of cross sectional area 4, Then
your applied pressure is
p=
Ay
Now this pressure is transmitted through the liquid in all directions and it will
also be applied on the cross sectional area of the second cylinder.
Therefore the amount of force applied on the second cylinder will be
Fy =PAy =F, &)

Figure 5.05: Force F, is obtained by
applying force F, which depends on the
