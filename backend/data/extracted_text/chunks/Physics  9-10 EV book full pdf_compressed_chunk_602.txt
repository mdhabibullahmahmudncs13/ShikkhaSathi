Reflection of Light 215

You can see that the wavelengths of visible light are very short but there are

many interesting experiments in physics, using these we can observe various

properties of this wavelength.

If we want to know more about light, we can start with reflection.

8.2. Reflection

If we talk about reflection what we

imagine is standing in front of a

mirror, but reflection is much absorption

more than that. When light is reflection

sent from one medium to another, hese

three different phenomena occur

simultaneously. One of them is

reflection and the other two are

refraction and absorption. (Figure first medium second medium

8.02)
