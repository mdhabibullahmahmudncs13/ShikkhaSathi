========================================

through the machine and then returns to the source through the neutral
wire. A voltage less neutral wire is safe, but a high voltage wire should be used
cautiously. When a switch is used to connect electricity to a machine, it can be
connected with a high voltage wire or a neutral wire. It is wise to connect the
switch with the high voltage wire (Figure 11.15). Then high voltage enters the
machine only when the switch is on. When the switch is off, there is no high
voltage inside the machine.
(f) Ground: You may have noticed that there are at least two connections in an
electric supply in school or at home, high voltage and neutral. But if an
expensive machine (e.g. computer, fridge) is connected to the current, you will
