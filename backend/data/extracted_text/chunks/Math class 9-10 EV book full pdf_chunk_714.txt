========================================

Constructions
We know that bounded plane figures may have different shapes. If the region is
bounded by four sides, it is known as quadrilateral. Quadrilaterals have classification
and they are also named based on their shapes and properties. Apart
from these, there are many regions bounded by more than four sides.
These are polygonal regions or simply polygons. Every closed region has a
certain measurement which is called the area of the region. For measurement of
areas usually the area of a square with sides of 1 unit of length is used as the
unit area and their areas are expressed in square units. For example, the area of
Bangladesh is 1.47 lacs square kilometers (approximately). In our day to day life
we need to know and measure areas of polygons for meeting the necessity of life.
