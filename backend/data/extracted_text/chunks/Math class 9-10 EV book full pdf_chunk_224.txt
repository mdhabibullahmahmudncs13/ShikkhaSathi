log table. Again, it can also be found by calculator. We shall find the mantissa
of the log of any number by using 2nd method, that is by calculator.
Example 12. Find the characteristic and the mantissa of log2717 :
Solution: Let us use the calculator: 2717 [-] 3.43409
.. Characteristic of log2717 is 3 and the mantissa is .43409
Example 13. Find the characteristic and the mantissa of log43.517.
Solution: Let us use the calculator: 43.517 [-] 1.63866
.. Characteristic of log43.517 is 1 and mantissa is .63866
Example 14. What are the characteristics and mantissa of log 0.008367
Solution: Let us use the calculator: 0.00836] [=| ~2.07779
—2.07779 = —3 + 0.92221 = 3.92221
.. Characteristic of 10g0.00836 is —3 and the mantissa is .92221.
Example 15. Find log, 10 :
