Step 4. But ABDE and ADEC are on the same side of the common base DE.

So they lie between a pair of parallel lines.

BC and DE are parallel.
Theorem 30. The internal bisector of an angle of a triangle divides its opposite
side in the ratio of the sides constituting to the angle.
Special Nomination: In AABC the line E
segment AD bisects the internal angle ZA and
intersects the side BC at D. It is required to A
prove that BD : DC = BA: AC.
Drawing: Draw the line segment C'E parallel
to DA, so that it intersects the side BA produced
B D C
