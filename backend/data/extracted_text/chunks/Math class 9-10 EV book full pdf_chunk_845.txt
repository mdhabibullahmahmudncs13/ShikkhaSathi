where, = required mean, a = approximate mean, f; =class frequency of ith
class, u; f; =-the product of step deviation with class intervals of ith class and h =
class interval, k= number of class and n= total number of frequency.
Example 8. The production cost (in hundred taka) of a commodity at different
stages is shown in the following table. Find the mean of the expenditure by short-
