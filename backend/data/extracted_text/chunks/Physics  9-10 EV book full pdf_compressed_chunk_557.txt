only two easy matters are shown in figure 7.03. The two waves, can reinforce
one another or can destroy each other.
@ Do Yourself

Pour some water on a big plate in a bright place. Make sure that there is

no vibration on the plate. If you touch any point of the water, the wave

will spread around from that point and at the bottom of the plate you will

see its shadow or reflections. Touching just the centre of the water of the

plate, you will see a wave starting from the centre and spreading to the

edge of the plate and again returning to the centre after reflection from

there. If the wave can be created properly, meeting at the centre it will

again spread around. If you try a little bit, you can measure the velocity

of this wave. Try and see.
