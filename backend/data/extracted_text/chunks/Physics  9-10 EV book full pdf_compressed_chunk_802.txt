302 Physics
produced by a chemical reaction inside the battery cell, if the flow of
charge starts, chemical substances start decreasing. When chemical
substances are finished, battery cells cannot create a flow of electricity.
The ordinary battery cells that we see regularly have a potential difference
of 1.5 volt.
For the supply of electricity that you have in your school or residence,
there are two points for using it, one of them is at higher potential and the
other one is at lower potential. This difference in potential is maintained by
a generator, which develops this continuously. A battery cell or a generator
has to send charges continuously from low potential to high potential for
continuous flow of electricity, and for that it needs energy. If # amount of
