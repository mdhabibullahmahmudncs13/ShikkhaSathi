========================================

line. So, we find the image J
of the point X, as before. f f f Y
The ray from point X which is x
parallel to the axis will
go through the focal Figure 9.24: If he object is at the outside the
point F. Another ray will focal length but inside the twice of the focal
pass through the center length, the real, inverted and bigger image is
point along line XO. formed.
The point x, where the two
lines meet, is the image of point X. If a normal is drawn from X' to the axis
YO, then the point will be the position of the image of the point Y. Therefore, for
the image of XY. we can say :
