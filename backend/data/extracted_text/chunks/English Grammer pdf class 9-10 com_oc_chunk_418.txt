========================================

it sound a little more formal.

3. Here is another informal letter. Read the following letter and say what

aspects of the letter make it informal?

Hi Stella, |
It seems hard to believe that I've been here in Sylhet for a whole week
now. I promised to write and tell you how I was getting on-so here it goes.
When | first got here, | could not just get used to the new environment
with new friends, in new school. Now, though, I'm learning to take things
easy and I'm beginning to feel really at home. My first impression of the
Sylheti people is that they are really, really friendly and heipful.

I've managed to make friends with a few girls. The countryside round the
town is marvelous and very green, because it rains a lot here, but too
much of rain can really be boring.
