13.1 Radioactivity
We all know, there is a nucleus at the center of an atom, and there are protons and
neutrons in the nucleus. The number of revolving electrons around the nucleus
is equal to the number of protons in it. The radius of the nucleus is about one
lakh times smaller than the radius of the atom. But the actual mass of the atom is
the mass of its nucleus even though its size is small, because the mass of the
electron is 1836 times less than that of the proton or neutron.
A proton is positively charged, so the nucleus cannot be formed only with
protons because the protons will be thrown off due to strong repulsion force. So
there is charge-less neutrons with protons in the nucleus, and nuclei become
