========================================

ii) Adverb Clauses: A subordinate clause functions as an adverb if it
modifies a verb, an adjective, or an adverb. Such clauses are sometimes
called adverb clauses.
Here are some examples of adverb clauses:
Before you buy a television, you should compare prices.
(modifies verb)
Aleya was proud that the theatre group chose her.
(modifies adjective)
Like adverbs, adverb clauses tell how, when, where, and to what extent.
They may also explain why.
Look at the following sentences:
How The building swayed as though it would collapse.
When Before the storm started, Nayan took shelter in a building.
Where We can have lunch wherever you want.
To What Extent Maya studied the poem until she had memorized it.
Why Shahed came early so that he would get a good seat.
