========================================

called the primary coil and the right side coil (from where voltage is returned
back) is called the secondary coil. You may think that if it is possible to be
happened, then why don’t we arrange an enormous amount of electrical energy
by giving small numbers of turns and applying small voltage in the primary coil
and by giving much more turns in the secondary coil, and thus obtaining a much
higher voltage? We have to remember one thing: the amount of electrical energy
applied per second is measured by the formula VI (voltage x current). The
