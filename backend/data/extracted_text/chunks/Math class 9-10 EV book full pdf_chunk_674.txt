========================================

proportional |
Step 2. The heights of AADE and ADEC are equal
cL —— = = [The bases of the triangles of equal height are
proportional |
Step 3. But ABDE = ADEC [On the same base DE and between same
pair of lines]
. AADE  AADE
""ABDE  ADEC
AD AE
Step 4. Therefore, DB EC
ie, AD: DB = AE : EC
Corollary 1. If the line parallel to BC of the triangle ABC intersects the sides
. AB AC AB AC
AB and AC at D and E respectively, then iD - AE and BD CE
Corollary 2. The line through the mid point of a side of a triangle parallel to
another side bisects the third line.
The proposition opposite of theorem 28 is also true. That is if a line segment
=o divides the two sides of a triangle or the line produced proportionally, it is parallel
S to the third side. Here follows the proof of the theorem.
