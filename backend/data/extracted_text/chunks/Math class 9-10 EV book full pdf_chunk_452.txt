Naming of sides of a right-angled triangle
We know that, the sides of right-angle triangle are known as hypotenuse, base
and height. This is successful for the horizontal position of triangle. Again, the
naming of sides is based on the position of one of the two acute angles of right-
angled triangle. As for example :
1. ‘(hypotenuse)’ the side of a right-angled triangle, which is the opposite side
of the right angle.
2. ‘(opposite side)’, which is the direct opposite side of a given angle.
3. ‘(adjacent side)’, which is a line segment constituting the given angle.
