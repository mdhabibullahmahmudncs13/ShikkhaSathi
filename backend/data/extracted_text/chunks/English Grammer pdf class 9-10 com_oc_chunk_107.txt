========================================

Where were you yesterday?
To make questions with other verbs in the simple past, we usually use did +
subject + infinitive:
Did you buy that book?
When did he visit England?
Why did he go there?
To make a negative, we add not/n’t to was/were and did:
No, he wasn’t a clerk in the bank.
