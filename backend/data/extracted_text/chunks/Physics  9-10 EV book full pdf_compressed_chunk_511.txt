========================================

starts is called the melting point. If we continue to measure the temperature,
surprisingly we will notice that when fusion has started, the temperature of the
mixture of some amount of solid and some amount of liquid does not increase
any more even if heat is applied (as shown in the figure 6.08). During this time
the heat is used to loosen the intermolecular bonds of the molecules in the solid.
So, the temperature cannot rise because applied heat cannot make the
molecules move further. During fusion at a definite melting point the amount of
heat which is used to convert the whole solid into liquid, is called the Latent Heat
of Fusion.
