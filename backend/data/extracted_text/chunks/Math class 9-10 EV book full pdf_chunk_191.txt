Very large or very small numbers or expressions can easily be expressed by using
exponents. As a result, calculations and solution of mathematical problems
become easier. Scientific or standard form of a number is expressed by using
exponents. Therefore, every student should have the knowledge of exponents
and its applications.
Exponents be get logarithms. Multiplication and division of numbers or expressions
and exponent related calculations have become easier with the help of logarithms.
