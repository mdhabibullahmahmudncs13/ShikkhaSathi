========================================

3. AB is a diameter of a circle and BC' is a chord equal to its radius. If the
tangents drawn at A and C' meet each other at the point D, prove that,
ACD is an equilateral triangle.

4. Prove that a circumscribed quadrilateral of a circle having the angles
subtended by opposite sides at the centre are supplementary.

5. PA and PB aretwo tangent from the point P external to circle with centre
0.

1) Construct the figure according to the stimulus.

2) Prove that, PA = PB

3) Prove that, the segment OP is perpendicular bisector of the tangent
chord.

6. Given, O is the centre of the circle and two tangents PA and PB touch
the circle at the point A and B respectively. Prove that, PO is the bisector
of ZAPB.
