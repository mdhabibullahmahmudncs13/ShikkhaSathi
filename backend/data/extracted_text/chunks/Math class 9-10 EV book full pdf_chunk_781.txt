Let us draw a radius r with centre O. The
circular segment AOB stands on the arc APB whose c
measurement is #. Draw a perpendicular OC" on OA - B

Example 19. The radius of a circle is 8 cm and a circular segment subtends
an angle 56° at the centre. Find the length of the arc and area of the circular
segment.
