station. Though heat is produced here directly, using this heat energy steam is
produced and this steam is used to rotate the turbine, then this rotating turbine
generates electricity in a generator(Fig: 4.05).
We have to know an important matter though such types of transformation are
taking place around us. Although there is available energy, but this energy
cannot always be used. In the oceans of the earth, there is a huge amount of
energy, but we cannot use this energy. (Sometimes using this energy cyclones
destroy cities, habitations!) When energy is transformed from one form to
another form, then a part of it is dissipated. Actually this dissipation occurs in the
form of heat energy and this cannot be regained for further use. This dissipation
