========================================

Let the first term of an arithmetic series be 3 and the common difference be 2.
Then nth term of the series is = 3+ (n—1) x 2 = 2n + 1.

Work: If the first term of an arithmetic series is 5 and common difference
is 7, determine the first six terms, 22nd term, rth term and (2p + 1)th term.

Example 2. Of the series 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 + --- which term is 3837

Solution: The first term of the series a = 5, common difference d = 8 — 5 =
11-8=14-11=3

It is an arithmetic series.

Let, nth term of the series = 383

We know that, nth term = a + (n — 1)d

coa+(n—1)d=2383

or, 5+ (n—1)3 =383

or, 5+ 3n — 3 = 383

or, 3n =383 -5+3

or, 3n = 381

381

or, n= =

or, n= 127

127th term of the given series is 383
