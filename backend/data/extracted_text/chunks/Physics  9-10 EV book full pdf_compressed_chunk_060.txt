========================================

Ampere (A): Flow of 1/1.602176634x10""” numbers of charge equivalent to

charge of electron in one second is called one ampere.

Mole (Mol): Amount of substance that contains 6.02214076x10% particles

(Avogadro’s number) is called one mole.

Kelvin (K): Amount of change of temperature with the change of

1.380649x10 joule heat is called one kelvin.

Candela (cd): One candela is defined as the amount of 1/683 watt luminous

intensity which is emitted by a source of light vibrating 540x10" cycle per

second into one Steradian solid angle. Table 1.04: New Sl unit

You should have a practical idea about how

much is meant by one meter, what amount of

mass is one kilogram, what time is one

second, how much hot is one kelvin

temperature, what amount of electric current -
