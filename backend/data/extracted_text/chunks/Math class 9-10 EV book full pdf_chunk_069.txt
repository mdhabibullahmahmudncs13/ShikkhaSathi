========================================

2) Express B = {y : y integer and y* < 18} by using set building method.
Finite Set
The set number of elements of which can be determined by counting is called
finite set. For example, D = {x,y,z}, EF = {3.6,9,...,60}, FF = {x : = prime
and 30 < x < 70} etc are finite sets. Here, set D contains 3 elements, set E 20
clements and set £9 elements.
Infinite Set
The set elements of which cannot be exhausted by counting is called infinite
set. For example, A = {z : x odd natural number}, set of natural numbers N =
{1.2,3,4,...}, set of integers Z = {...,—3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3...}, set of rational
numbers QQ = {3 ca and b integer and b # 0}. set of rational numbers R etc are
infinite sets.
Example 4. Prove that the set of all natural numbers is an infinite set.
