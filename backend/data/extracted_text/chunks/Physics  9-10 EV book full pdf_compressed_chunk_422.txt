State of Matter and Pressure 145
The pressure on the surface of the earth originates from the weight of the air
column. So if we rise above then the height of the air column above us will
decrease, the weight will also decrease, due to this the air pressure will also
decrease there. The matter is true and how this air pressure decreases with height
is shown in Figure 5.09. What you have to observe separately is that the air
pressure has decreased by half after reaching a height of five kilometer.
Generally, one may ask by reduction of pressure why does it not become zero
after the next five kilometer? There is a specific reason behind it. Air or gas can
be compressed by putting a pressure. So on the surface of the earth, air becomes
