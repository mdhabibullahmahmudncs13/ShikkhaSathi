========================================

power and a is base. Conversely a" =a x a X a X ... X a (n times a).
Exponents may not only be positive integers, they may be negative integers or
positive fractions or negative fractions. That is, for base a € R (set of real
numbers) and power n € @ (set of rational numbers), a” is defined. The case of
n € N (set of natural numbers) is especially considered. Besides, exponents may
also be irrational. But as it is out of curriculum, it has not been discussed in this
chapter.
