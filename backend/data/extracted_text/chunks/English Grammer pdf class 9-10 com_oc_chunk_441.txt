Informal passage
A Discuss what makes the following passage informal.
Well, they had us take a look at the kids every day, and we'd write down lot of
things they did and said. There was this one teacher the kids really did things
for. This was because she was damn good at maths and could turn the kids on
to it. At the end of the week we all got together to talk about what we'd found
out since we got there. We all felt that you could pick up an awful lot about how
to teach just from watching what the kids did whenever the teacher told them
to do something.
B The passage below is the formal version of the above passage. How is
