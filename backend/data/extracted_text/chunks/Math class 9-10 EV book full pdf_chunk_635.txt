========================================

or, 3n =383 -5+3

or, 3n = 381

381

or, n= =

or, n= 127

127th term of the given series is 383

Sum of n terms of an arithmetic series

Let the first term of any arithmetic series be a, last term be p, common difference
be d, number of terms be n and sum of n terms be S,,.

Writing from the first term to the last and conversely from the last term to the
first of the series we get,

Sp=a+(a+d)+(a+2d) +--+ (p—2d)+(p—d) +p...(1)

and S, =p+(p—d)+(p—2d) +--+ (a+2d) + (a+d) +a...(2)

Adding, 28, = (a +p) + (a +p) + (a+p) +--+ (a+p) + (a+p) + (a+p)
or, 25, = na +p) [. number of terms of the series is n |

SS = Fla+p) ...(3)
Again, nth term = p = a + (n — 1)d. Putting this value of p in (3) we get,
