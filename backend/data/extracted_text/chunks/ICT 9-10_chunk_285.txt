========================================

editing can be done by putting numerous transparent canvases one after another.

If the canvas is transparent, editing becomes easier as the existing photos can be

watched, but if the canvas of the upper layer is not transparent, the editing of the

lower layer cannot be seen. If any photo with colour background is opened,

Background" will be written on the layer palette. The background will not be

transparent in spite of being white because white is a colour.
