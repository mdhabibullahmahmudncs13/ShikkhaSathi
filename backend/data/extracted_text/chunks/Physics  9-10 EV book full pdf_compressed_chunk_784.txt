Static Electricity 293
Millions of amperes of electric current can flow during a thunderbolt and for this
flow of current, the temperature of the air can rise up to 20-30 thousand degree
Celsius which is even more than the temperature of the sun!
For this temperature we see a bluish white sparkling in the sky. Another thing
occurs due to this temperature; the air expands to a great extent and moves
outside, and in the very next moment air from the outside fills in that blank space
created. This whole thing occurs faster than the speed of sound and an incredibly
loud noise is created. When the speed of air exceeds that of sound, it is called a
shockwave. The sound of a thunderbolt is a kind of shockwave. Although the
