Chapter 12. Simple Simultaneous Equations in Two Variables 245
Here, multiplying both sides of first equation by 2, we get, 4x + 2y = 24
second equation is, dz + 2y = 5
subtracting, 0 = 19 which is impossible.

So, we can say, such systems of equations cannot be solved. Such systems
of equations are inconsistent and mutually independent. Such systems of
equations have no solution.
Here, comparing the coefficients of 2 and y and constant terms from the two
2 1,12

equations, we get, — = — # —

q get, = 57
That is, in case of the system of inconsistent and mutually independent
equations ratios of the coefficients of the variables are not equal to the ratio
of the constant terms.

Generally, conditions for conformability of two simple simultaneous equations,
