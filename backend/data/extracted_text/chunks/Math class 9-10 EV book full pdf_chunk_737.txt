1. Right-angled triangle: Let in the right-angled A
triangle ABC, BC = a and AB = b are the adjacent
sides of the right angle. Here if we consider BC' as b
the base and AB as the height,
Area of AABC = x base x height = Jab Cc a B
2. Two sides of a triangular region and the angle
included between them are given:
Let in AABC, the sides are BC =a, CA=0b, AB=c.
AD is drawn perpendicular from A to BC. Let
altitude (height) AD = h. A
— AD
Commdering the angle C' we get, i= sinC' ¢ b
or, a sinC or, h = bsinC'
1 B D Cc
Arca of AABC = -BC x AD
1 1 2 «— a—->
= 30 x bsinC' = absinC
Similarly, area of AABC'
1. 1
= be sind = 50a sinB
3. Three sides of a triangle are given:
Let in AABC, BC' =a, CA =D and A
AB =c.
