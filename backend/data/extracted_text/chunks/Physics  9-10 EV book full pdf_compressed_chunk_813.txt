direction of flow of electrons. (All problems could have been solved if we
assume the charge of electron is positive, but it has been too late!)
11.2 Relationship between Potential Difference and Electricity
Now we will discuss actual flow of current in a real circuit. We have said before
that if there is a potential difference between two points and if we connect these
two points with a conducting wire, electric current will start flowing between the
points, though we haven't discussed the amount of electric current. Not only that,
will the amount of current that flows if the connection is made by a gold wire be
equal to the current that will flow through the connection made by an iron wire?
