========================================

you think a bit. Because if the pressure is not transmitted into the whole liquid
then the pressure experienced in one part will be more and it will be less in
another part. Therefore if we imagine a cross sectional area then force applied
from one direction will be more than the force from an other direction and due
to this force the liquid will flow until the pressure becomes equal. Pascal
expressed this in the form of a law, that is stated below:
Pascal’s Law: If pressure is applied on a liquid or a gas enclosed in a
container from outside, then this pressure is transmitted equally and acts
perpendicularly on the surface of the container in contact with the liquid or
gas.
