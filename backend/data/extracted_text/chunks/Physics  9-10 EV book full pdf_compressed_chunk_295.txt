========================================

work was done by the force applied by you? Certainly you have noticed that, this

time the distance traversed is not along the direction of force, rather opposite to

it. So the amount of work done

W=F (-s)=-Fs

That is, the work done is negative. In our daily lives, we talk about work and

useless work, but what is meant by positive and negative work in terms of

physics? If the work is positive, then it can be said that the work is done by the force.

If it is negative, then it is said that the work is done ‘on’ the force or against the

force. We must have a clear conception about energy before understanding what

has just been written.

4.2 Energy

In our daily life we use the term “energy” for different purposes but in physics it
