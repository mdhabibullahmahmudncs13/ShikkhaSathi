Each regular polygons is a figure of symmetry. Therefore, it is necessary to know
their lines of symmetry. Each regular polygon has many lines of symmetry as it
has many sides.

The concept of line symmetry is closely related to mirror
reflection. A geometrical figure has line symmetry when
one half of it is the mirror image of the other half. So, the
