========================================

23 when they divide 311 and 419.
Solution: The natural numbers that leave 23 as residue when they divide 311
and 419 will be bigger than 23 and will be common factors of both 311 — 23 = 288
and 419 — 23 = 396.
Let the set of factors of 288 are larger than 23 be A.
Here 288 = 1x 288 =2x 144 =3x96=4x72=6x48=8x36=9 x32 =
12x24 =16 x 18
A= {24,32,36,48, 72,96, 144, 288}
Let the set of factors of 396 greater than 23 be B.
Here 396 = 1x 396 =2x 198 =3 x 132 =4x99 =6 x66 =9 x 44 = 11 x 36 =
12x33 =18 x22
"- B= {33,36,44,66,99,132,198,396}
