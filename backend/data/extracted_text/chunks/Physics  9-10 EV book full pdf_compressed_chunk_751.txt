========================================

repel each other. But we do not

know yet how attraction or

repulsion works. To know this, we r

need to look at Coulomb's law. q; qa,

Coulomb determined how much

force works between two charges. Figure 10.09: The force F acting

We have already seen such a law, between two charges ¢, and ¢ , can

Newton's gravitational force law, either be attractive or repulsive.

which is as follows:

mm,
F=6—2
r

The interesting thing is, if mass m1 and m, is replaced by ¢, and ¢,, we get
& Coulomb's law. G was the constant for gravitational force, now we will use the
S

F=k (6 1%

the unit of k will be Nm?*/C?, so that the unit of F becomes N.

The value of &:
k =9 x 10° Nm2/C?
