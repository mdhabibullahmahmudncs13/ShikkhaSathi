Quadrilateral inscribed in a circle (Inscribed
Quadrilaterals)
An inscribed quadrilateral or a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle is a quadrilateral
having all four vertices on the circle. Such quadrilaterals possess a special property.
The following work helps us understand this property.
‘Work: Draw a few inscribed quadrilaterals. This can easily be accomplished

points on each of the circles. Measure the angles of the quadrilaterals and fill
in the following table.
