========================================

n
SS = Fla+p) ...(3)
Again, nth term = p = a + (n — 1)d. Putting this value of p in (3) we get,

n

S, = sla + {a+ (n—1)d}]
ie. S, = Hea +(n—1)d}...(4)
If the first term of an arithmetic series a, last term p and number of terms n are
known, the sum of the series can be determined by the formula (3). But if the
first term a, common difference d and number of terms n are known, the sum of
the series are determined by the formula (4).
Determination of the sum of first n terms of natural numbers
Let S,, be the sum of n-numbers of natural numbers i.e.
Sp=142+3+--+(n—1)+n
Writing from the first term and conversely from the last term of the series we get,

Sp=1+2+4+34+-+n—-2)+n—-1)+n...(1)
