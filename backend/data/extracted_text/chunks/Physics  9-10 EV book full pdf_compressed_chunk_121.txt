2.3 Scalar and Vector quantities
In the world we know anything that can be
measured is called a quantity. Joy and sorrow
are not quantities but temperature is a quantity.
Because joy and sorrow cannot be assigned a he]
value by measuring them but temperature can A
be given a value by measurement. The c
temperature of your body is 37°C or 98.4°F. To
express temperature a single number is
sufficient, but there are many quantities which B
cannot be expressed by a single number
completely; with its magnitude its direction has
to be mentioned or more than one magnitude Figure 2.03: Vector A and vector
has to be mentioned so that they altogether can B are equal in all respect although
express definitely the magnitude and direction 1 different position, vector Cis
