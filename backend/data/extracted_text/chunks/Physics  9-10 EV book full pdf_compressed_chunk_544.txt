========================================

the position of the end of the spring is at a distance x from its equilibrium
position, then the restoring force Fof the spring is given by:
F = —kx
The harmonic or oscillatory motion that obeys Hooke’s law is called simple
harmonic motion. This is one of the most important motions in physics.

In your book, there is no scope of deducing it, but there is no harm in knowing
it.
If the spring constant of a spring is & and m is the attached mass, then the time
period of the mass is,

If instead of being a spring, it would be a pendulum and if the length of the
pendulum is / and gravitational acceleration is g, then the time period is:
