The Noun 13
C Nouns in Apposition :
Apposition means “placing near”. It is a grammatical arrangement in which
two words referring to the same person or thing are placed side by side ina
sentence.
Read the following passage and notice the underlined words.
Mr. Rahman, our Headmaster, is a very nice man. My friend, Nazrul and | saw
him yesterday. He discussed many things with both of us. He also talked about
his childhood days. We alse met his wife, Mrs Salma Begum. She is our English
teacher. We like both of them.
In the first sentence, Rahman and Headmaster refer to the same person. The
noun “Headmaster” follows the noun “Rahman” simply to mean which
Rahman is referred to. Here the second noun “Headmaster” is said to be in
apposition to the first noun “Rahman”.
