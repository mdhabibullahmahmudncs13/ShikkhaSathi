Example 14. Find mode from the frequency distribution table given below.
6170] 71-50
ET AE
Solution: Here, maximum numbers of frequency are 25 which lie in the class
(41-50). So it is evident that mode is in this class. We know that
Mode= r+ xh. Here, L =41, fi =25-0=25, fo, =25-20=5 [If the
1+ fo
frequency is maximum in the first class, the frequency of previous class is zero]
25 25
© Mode =41 + —— x 10 =41 + — x 10 = 41 + 8.33 = 49.33
.. Mode tops < 3 +
Required mode 49.33.
Example 15. Find mode from the frequency distribution table given below.
11-20 [21-30 [31-40 [ 41 — 50
Solution: The maximum numbers of Class Frequency frequency are 25 which lie
