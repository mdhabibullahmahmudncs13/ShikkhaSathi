20. ABCD is a parallelogram and BCEF is a rectangle and BC is the base of
both of them.

1) Draw a figure of the rectangle and the parallelogram assuming the same
height.

2) Show that the perimeter of ABCD is greater than the perimeter of
BCEF.

3) Ratio of length and width of the rectangle is 5: 3 and its perimeter is
48 metre. Determine the area of the parallelogram

21. The perimeters of a square region and a rectangular region are same. The
length of the rectangle is 3 times of its width and its area is 1200 square
metre.

1) Determine the perimeter of the rectangle using the variable x.

2) Determine the area of the square region.

3) Consider a 1.5 metre wide path just around the rectangular region.
How many 25 x 12.5 square cm bricks will be required to make the
path metalled ? g
