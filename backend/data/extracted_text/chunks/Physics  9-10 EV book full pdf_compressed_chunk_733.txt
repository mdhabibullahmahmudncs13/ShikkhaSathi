========================================

electron is negatively charged. The charge of a proton and electron is equal but
opposite and the magnitude of this charge is 1.6 x 10” coulomb. In an atom
generally there are the same number of electrons and protons and so an atom is
charge neutral. Hydrogen is the simplest atom. The nucleus of hydrogen atom
consists of only one proton and only one electron is revolving around it. The
next atom is helium which consists of two protons in the nucleus (and two
chargeless neutron) and two electrons outside the nucleus. In this way larger
atoms are formed. Excluding hydrogen atom, we can say the number of protons
that a nucleus there is at least the same number or generally more than this
number of neutrons present.
