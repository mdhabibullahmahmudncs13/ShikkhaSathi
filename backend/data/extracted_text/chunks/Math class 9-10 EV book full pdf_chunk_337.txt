========================================

But this is also against the supposition.
Step 2. Therefore, the side AC is neither equal to nor less than AB.
AC > AB (Proved).
There is a relation between the sum or the difference of the lengths of two sides
and the length of the third side of a triangle.
Theorem 13. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater
than the third side.
>
Let ABC be a triangle. Let BC be the greatest side 2
of the triangle. Then, AB + AC > BC.
"
Corollary 5. The difference of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is
smaller than the third side.
Let ABC be a triangle. Then the difference of the lengths of any two of its sides
is smaller than the length of third side, i.e: AB — AC" < BC. g
