in on them while they are sleeping.

(The examples above have been taken from Warriner’s English Grammar and

Composition, 1973)

A sentence may have more than one subordinate clause. For example,

see the last sentence above.

B1 Kinds of subordinate clauses:

A subordinate clause may function as an adjective, an adverb, or a

noun.

i) Clauses used as adjectives: A subordinate clause functions as an
adjective if it modifies a noun or a pronoun. Such clauses are
sometimes called adjective clauses.

Look at the following sentences. The subjects of the subordinate

clauses are underlined, and the predicates are shown in bold type.
