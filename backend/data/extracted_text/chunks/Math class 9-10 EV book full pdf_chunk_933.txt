========================================

join B and D. 4 c
Proof:
1. In AABD, AB=AD.
Hence, ZADB=/ABD [Since in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the
equal sides are equal].
2. In ABDC, the external angle ZADB>/BCD [As an exterior angle is
greater than either of the interior opposite angles].
Therefore, ZABD>/BCD or ZABD>/ACB.
3. ZABC>ZABD [because ZABD is part of ZABC].
Therefore, ZABC>ZACB (Proved).
