1 =6 — =273
he 50 x 6 x 100
Hence, profit is Tk. 273.
Example 41. Find the compound principal and compound profit of Tk. 15000
in 3 years at the profit of 6 percent per annum.
Solution: We know, C' = P(1 +r)" [where C' is the profit principal in the case
of compound profit]

Given, P = 15000 Tk, r = 6% = 00’ n = 3 year
