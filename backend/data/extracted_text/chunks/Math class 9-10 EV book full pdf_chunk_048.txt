Example 12. Subtract 5.24673 from 8.243.
Solution: Here number of digits in nonrepeating part should be 2 and that in
repeating part should be 6, LCM of 2 and 3. Now the numbers have been converted
into similar numbers, and subtraction has been performed as follows:
8.243 = 8.24343434
5.24673 = 524673673
2.99669761 | subtracting 6 from 3 results in 1 in hand |
—1
2.99669760
The desired result is 2.99669760.
Remarks: If the minuend starting at the repeating dot is smaller than the
subtrahend, we must subtract 1 from the rightmost digit.
Note: In the following is explained why 1 is subtracted from the rightmost
digit in different way.
8.243 =8.2434343434
5.24673 = 5.24673673/67
