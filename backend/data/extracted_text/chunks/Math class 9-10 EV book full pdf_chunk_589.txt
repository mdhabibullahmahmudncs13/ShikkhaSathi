Solving by using Graphical Method
In a simple equation in two variables, the relation of existing variables x and y
and can be expressed by picture. This picture is called the graph of that relation.
In the graph of such equation, there exist infinite number of points. Plotting a
few such points and joining them with each other, we get the graph.
Each of a simple simultaneous equations has infinite number of solutions. Graph
of each equation is a straight line. Coordinates of each point of the straight line
satisfies the equation. To indicate a graph, two or more than two points are
necessary.
Now we shall try to solve graphically the following system of equations:
2w+y=3...(1)
dr+2y=6...(2)
From equation (1) we get, y = 3 — 2x.
