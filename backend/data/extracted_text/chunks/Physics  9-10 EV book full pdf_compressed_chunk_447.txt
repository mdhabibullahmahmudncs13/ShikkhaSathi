========================================

but it exerts pressure on the walls of the container in all directions. (If a hole is created in
the wall of the container, the liquid will come out through this hole due to the pressure of
liquid.) If we want to put gas then it is not possible to put it in a open container, then it is
to be stored in a bound region and the gas will exert pressure on the bound surface in all
directions. Gas is contained in a balloon. If we make a hole on a balloon, air will come
out through this hole due to the air pressure.
