286 English Grammar and Composition
Activity 5
Read the following poem. Write a summary of the poem in 4 to 5 sentences.
Strange Dreams Come True
In years gone by
Men thought and dreamed
Of things that could not be-
Like the traveling
Up in the sky,
Or, deep down in the sea;
Or, watching things
That eyes can't see-
Too little- or too far-
Or hearing distant
Voice or sound,
No matter where you are.
But now we have
The radio,
And subs and cars and jets,
And phones and trains,
And microscopes
And television sets.
So many things
Have seemed absurd,
But in men’s minds they grew-
The dreams which were
Impossible
Have in the end come true!
ES
