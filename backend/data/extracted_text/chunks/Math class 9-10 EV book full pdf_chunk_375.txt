========================================

b
0A =0C= 3 OB =0D = 3 [by construction]
and included ZAOB = included ZCOD [opposite angle]
.AAOB = ACOD
AB = CD and ZABO = ZODC, but the angles are alternate angles.
AB and CD are parallel and equal.
Similarly, AD and BC are parallel and equal.
Therefore, ABCD is the required parallelogram.
Example 3. The parallel sides and two angles included with the larger side of
a trapezium are given. Construct the trapezium.
Let a and b be the parallel sides of a trapezium where a > b and Zz and Zy be
two angles included with the side a. The trapezium is to be constructed.
