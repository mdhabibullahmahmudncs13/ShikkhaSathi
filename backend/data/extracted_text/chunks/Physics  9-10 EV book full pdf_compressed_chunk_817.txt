========================================

conductor for the same potential difference. It is as if the flow of current is easier
through the first conductor and a little difficult through the second one. To
explain the matter, a quantity named ‘resistance to current flow” or simply
‘resistance’ has been introduced. We can see that the relation between voltage
and electric current can be expressed by a law which is known as Ohm’s law.

“Rr
So, the higher the resistance, the lower is the electric current. And the lower the
resistance, the higher is the current.
The unit of resistance is Ohm and it is expressed by the Greek letter Q. If 1 V
potential difference is applied in an electric circuit and if it is seen that 1 A
current flows as a result, it can be said that the resistance of the circuit is 1 Q.
