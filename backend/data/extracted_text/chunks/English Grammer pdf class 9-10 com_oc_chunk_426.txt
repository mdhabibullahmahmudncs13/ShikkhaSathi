Subject: A complaint letter regarding customer service
Dear Sir or Madam,
1 am writing to complain about a leather jacket which | bought from your
store 3 weeks ago. | had tried a jacket on in the shop and checked it
carefully before | decided to buy it. When | went to the cash desk,
however, the assistant persuaded me to take one which was already
packaged and assured me that it was perfect.
When | reached home and tried the jacket on, | found a large rip under the
Gi side pocket. As you will realize, | was extremely upset to discover this.
