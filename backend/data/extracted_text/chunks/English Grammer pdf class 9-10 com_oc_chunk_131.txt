========================================

stadium since 12 noon as everybody wanted a good place to sit.

While waiting, the crowd (shout) to each other from their seats. A noisy

atmosphere (prevail) then, but as soon as the game started, a sudden

hush (fall) all over the stadium. People who (shout) all this time
(become) quiet. However when the first goal was scored, all the noise

that (prevail) earlier came back more powerfully than ever.

It was memorable experience for my friend and I. The team that we

(support) all along (win) the match.
