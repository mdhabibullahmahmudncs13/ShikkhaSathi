1. A wave is shown in Figure 7.15 with respect to time and position. What
is the velocity of the wave?

2. The ratio of velocity and of an object in a medium velocity of sound
in that medium iscalled MACH. What is the velocity of the fighter plane
MACH 9?

3. In summer, the velocity of sound is increased by 0.5 % in a town. If the
temperature in winter is 10°C, what is the temperature in the summer?
