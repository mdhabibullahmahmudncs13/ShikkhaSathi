or,z=1or, z= 3 = 7.67 (approx.)
But the thickness of a box cannot be greater than or equal to any of the
sides.
The required thickness of the box is 1 cm
3) Let, length of each side of ABCD is 10 cm and the diagonals intersect
each other at the point O.
We know, diagonals of rhombus bisect each other at,
right angle. D Cc

In the right-angled triangle AAOB, hypotenuse
AB =10 LN
Here, AB? = 10? = 100 = 36 + 64 A B
= 6% + 8% = OB? + OA? [according to the figure]
.OB=6, OA=8
diagonal AC’ =2 x 8=16 cm and diagonal BD =2 x 6 =12 cm
area of the rhombus ABCD = 3 x AC x BD = 3 x 16 x 12 = 96 square
