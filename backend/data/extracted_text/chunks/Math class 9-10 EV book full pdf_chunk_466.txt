Chapter 9. Trigonometric Ratio 199
‘Work:
1) If cot*A — cot?A = 1, prove that, cos? A + cos? A = 1
2) If sin®A + sin’A4 = 1, prove that, tan*A — tan?4 = 1
Example 12. If sec A+ tan A = 5 find the value of sec A — tan A.
Solution: Here given that, sec A + tan A = : (1D
We know that, sec?A = 1 4 tan’A
Or, sec?A — tan’A = 1
Or, (sec A+ tan A)(sec A — tan A) = 1
=
Or, Sse A—tan A) = 1 [From (1)]

cosec A—tan A = —

Exercise 9.1
1. Verify whether each of the following mathematical statements is true or
false. Give argument in favour of your answer.
1) The value of tan A is always less than 1.
2) cot A is the multiplication of cot and A
. 12
3) For any value of A, sec A = 5
4) cos is the smallest form of cotangent
