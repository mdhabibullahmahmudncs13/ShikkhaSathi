Solution:
1) Basic salary of Palash Sarker follows arithmetic series.
The first term of the series a = 120000 and common difference = 5000
.. The second term = 120000 + 5000 = 125000
The third term = 125000 + 5000 = 130000
.. The series is, 120000 + 125000 + 130000 + - - -
2) The total amount of salary excluding the provident fund from January 2005
to December 31, 2030 i.e. (2030 — 2005 + 1) or, 26 years is:
(120000 — 10% of 120000) + (125000 — 10% of 125000) + (130000 — 10% of
130000) + -- -
= (120000 — 12000) + (125000 — 12500) + (130000 — 13000) + - - -
= 108000 + 112500 + 117000 + - - -
In this cane it is an arithmetic series whose first term, a =108000, common
difference d = 112500 — 108000 = 4500 and number of terms n = 26
