========================================

Example 38. Price of a book is Tk. 24. This price is 80% of the actual price.
The Government subsidize the due price. How much money does the Government,
subsidize for each book?
Solution: Market price = 80% of the actual price
‘We know, p = br
Here, p =Tk.24 and r = 80% = 0
EE 100
80
S24 =bx —
100
b 24 x 100
rh =
on 80
».b=130 Tk.
Hence, the actual price of the book is Tk. 30.
.. Amount of subsidized money Tk. = (30 — 24) or Tk. =6
Hence, subsidized money for each book is Tk. 6.
Example 39. The loss is % when n oranges are sold per taka. How many
oranges are to be sold per taka to make a profit of s%?
Solution: If the cost price is Tk.100, the selling price at the loss of r% is Tk
(100 — 7). ,
If selling price is Tk. (100 — 7), cost price is Tk. 100 S
