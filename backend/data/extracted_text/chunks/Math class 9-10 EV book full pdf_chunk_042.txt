========================================

applying the rules and in case of finite decimal fractions, necessary numbers of
zeros are to be used in its repeating parts. Then the same process of addition
and subtraction is to be done following the rules of finite decimal fractions. The
sum or the difference thus obtained will not be the actual one. It should be
observed that in the process of addition of similar decimal fractions if any
number is to be carried over after adding the digits at the extreme left of the
repeating part of the decimal fractions, then that number is added to the sum
obtained and thus the actual sum is found. In case of subtraction the number
to be carried over is to subtract from the difference obtained and thus actual
result is found. The sum or difference thus found is the required sum or
difference.
