. . . [distance L 2
dimensions of acceleration: ———|= — = LT
time T?
In this book, when we will speak about a new quantity, we will try to mention
the dimension of it at the same time. You will see that, this always will help you
to understand the quantity, in a different way. To indicate the dimensions of a
quantity in this book, it will be shown within third brackets. For example, force
F is expressed as [F]= MLT.
