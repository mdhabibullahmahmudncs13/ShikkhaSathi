========================================

We know, = + 3 = 5 is an equation. To solve it, we find the value of the unknown
quantity xz. Here the unknown quantity x is a variable. Again, to solve the
equation z + a = 5, we find the value of z, not the value of a. Here, z is assumed
as variable and a as constant. In this case, we shall get the values of z in terms
of a. But if we determine the value of a, we shall write a = 5 — z; that is, the
value of a will be obtained in terms of x. Here a is considered a variable and x a
constant. But if no direction is given, conventionally x is considered a variable.
Generally, the small letter x,y, z, the ending part of English alphabet are taken as
variables and a, b, ¢, the starting part of the alphabet are taken as constants.
