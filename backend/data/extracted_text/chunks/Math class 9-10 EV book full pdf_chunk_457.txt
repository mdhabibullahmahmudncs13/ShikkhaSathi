Trigonometric ratios of an acute angle
Let ZXOA be an acute angle. We take any point
P on OA. We draw a perpendicular PM from the
point P to OA. A right angled triangle POM is formed. A
The six ratios are obtained from the sides PM, OM
and OP of APOM which are called trigonometric L
ratios of the angle ZXOA and each of them are
named particularly. With respect to the ZXOA of
right-angled triangle POM, PM is the opposite side, pa ~
OM is the adjacent side and OP is the hypotenuse.
Denoting ZXOA = 0, the obtained six ratios are
described below for the angle 6.
