========================================

That is, if an amount of heat Q is required to increase the temperature from 7’ to
T,, the specific heat will be:
_ Q
s=—0t
m(T, — Th)
Heat capacity C is the amount of heat required to increase the temperature 1K of
a body. The amount of heat required to increase the temperature 1K of a body of
mass 1 kg is called specific heat. So we can easily find out the heat capacity C of
a body if we know the specific heat of that substance. If the mass of an body is
., mand the specific heat is s, then the heat capacity will be:
