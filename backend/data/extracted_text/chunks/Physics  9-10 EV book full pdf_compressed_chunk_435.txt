========================================

condition. A permanent deformation could take place. This limit is termed as the
elastic limit. After bending a rod slightly, if it is released then it becomes straight.
If it is bent too much then it remains curved and does not become straight.
Therefore we can state this like:
Strain: The relative change in length or shape which is made by applying a force
from outside is called strain. Therefore, if force is applied on an object of
length L , and the changed length becomes L then it’s strain is: L — Lo BS
Lo
