3.9.3 Increase and Decrease of Friction
Already we know that for our necessity sometimes friction has to be increased
and sometimes it has to be decreased.
Reducing friction
The measures we may take to reduce friction are: en
1. Make the surfaces as smooth as possible 7 $= EN
where friction is take place. On smooth ‘TERY
surfaces sliding friction is less. = r I —| |
2. Oil, Mobil or grease like materials are called 1 \ og
greasy materials or lubricants. The friction is Ao, Sly
reduced to a great extent if lubricants are used ~ 24
in between the two surfaces.

bearings.
