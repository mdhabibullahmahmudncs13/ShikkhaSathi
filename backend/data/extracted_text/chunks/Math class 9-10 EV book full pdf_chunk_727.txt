========================================

Again ZOEF = Zax[since EF||C'B by construction].
So the parallelogram ECGF is the required parallelogram.
Construction 14. Construct a triangle with area of the triangular region equal
to that of a quadrilateral region.
D c
A B E
Let ABCD be a quadrilateral region. It is required to construct a triangle such
that area of the triangular region is equal to that of a rectangular region ABCD.
Drawing: Join D, B. Through C, draw C'E parallel to DB which intersects
the side AB extended at E. Join D, E. Then, ADAE is the required triangle.
Proof: ABDC and ABDE lie on the same base BD and CE || DB
(by construction).
area of ABDC = area of ABDE.
area of ABDC area of AABD = area of ABDE+ area of AABD
area of the quadrilateral region ABC'D = area of AADE. Therefore, AADE
g is the required triangle.
