Investigation 1.01
Objective: To find out the volume of a match box or any other object by’
measuring its length, breadth and height using a slide calipers. If you have
no slide calipers with you, you can make a slide calipers as shown in figure
1.10.
1. To measure the length of an object by slide calipers we need to place it
between the jaws of the slide calipers. The jaws need to touch the object
from both the sides.
2. Now observe carefully the mark of the main scale that the zero marking
of vernier scale has just crossed. Mark of the main scale that the. That will
be the main scale reading M. Notice that, the mark which is very close to the
main scale, is not the reading of main scale, the mark that has just crossed
