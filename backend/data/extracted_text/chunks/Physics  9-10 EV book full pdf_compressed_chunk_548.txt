started, then we say a complete oscillation has taken place. It has to be
remembered that completing 2 — 3 positions when the mass comes to the
position 4, it will come to the position from where it started, but it is not a
complete oscillation. Because at the first 2 position the mass moves upwards
and at the next 4 position it is moving downwards, therefore it did not come to
the same or initial position in the same manner.
To analyze the simple harmonic motion, it is better to explain some quantities.
The first may be the time period 7. The time required for one complete oscilla-
tion is called the time period. Frequency fis the number of complete oscillations
per second. Therefore, f = : . if time period is expressed in second, then unit of
