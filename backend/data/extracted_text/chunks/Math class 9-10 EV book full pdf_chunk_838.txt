Cumulative Frequency Diagram or Ogive curve: Cumulative frequency
diagram or Ogive curve is drawn by taking the upper limit of class interval along
with z-axis and cumulative frequency along with y-axis after classification of a
data.
Example 6. The frequency distribution table of the marks obtained by 50
students out of 60 students is as follows:
Class 1—-10(11 —20|21 — 30/31 — 40(41 — 50
interval
of marks
obtained
[Frequency | 8 | 12 | 15 | 18 | 7 |
Draw the Ogive curve of this frequency distribution.
Solution: The cumulative frequency table of frequency distribution of the given
data is :
Class 1-10] 11-20 | 21-30 31-40 | 41-50
interval
of marks
obtained
Frequency | § | 12 |B | | 7
