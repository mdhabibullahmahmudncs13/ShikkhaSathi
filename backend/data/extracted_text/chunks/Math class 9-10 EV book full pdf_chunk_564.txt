A A .  2r4y=12 .
1) As discussed earlier, the system of equations 3 has unique (only
r—y=
one) solution. Such systems of equations are called consistent. Comparing
the coefficient of and y (taking the ratio of the coefficients) of the two
2 1
equations, we get, 1 # —7 any equation of the system of equations cannot
be expressed in terms of the other. That is why, such systems of equations
are called mutually independent. In the case of consistent and mutually
independent system of equations, the ratios are not equal. In this case, the
constant terms need not to be compared.
. 20 —y=6
2) Now we shall consider the system of equations . Can these
dr —2y =12
two equations be solved?
Here, if both sides of first equation are multiplied by 2, we shall get the
