========================================

any real number. Besides, any real number can be used for the data related to
age, height, weight etc. That is why, the variables used for those are indiscrete
variables. The number between two indiscrete variables can be the value of those
variables. Some times it becomes necessary to make class interval indiscrete. To
make the class interval indiscrete, the actual higher limit of a class and the lower
limit of the next class are determined by fixing mid-point of a higher limit of any
class and the lower limit of the next class. Such as, in example 1 the actual
higher-lower limits of the first class are 8.5° and 5.5° respectively and that of the
second class are 11.5°  8.5° etc.
