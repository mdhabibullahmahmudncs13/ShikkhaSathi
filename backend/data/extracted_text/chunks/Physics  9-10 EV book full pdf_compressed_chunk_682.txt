========================================

amount of light will be reflected and some will be refracted . As 6, will be greater
than 6, therefore staying 6,(90°,6, will be equal to 90° and after this there will
be no scope of light to be refracted, i.e when 6, will be equal to 90°, total
light has to be reflected . The value of 6, at which 6, =90°is called the critical angle 6,
