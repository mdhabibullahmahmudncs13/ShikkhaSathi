Question: A force of 20 N is applied on a stationary object for 10 s and the
object covered a distance of 100 m. What is the mass of the object?

3.7 Gravitational Force
We have talked about force (which creates acceleration), how it is measured has
been discussed (product of mass and acceleration). But until now you have not
been introduced to a real force. In physics, an amazing force is the gravitational
force; a body having mass attracts another body by the gravitational force. Let
