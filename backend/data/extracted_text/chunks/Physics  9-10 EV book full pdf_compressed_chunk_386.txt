State of Matter and Pressure 131
it is possible to cut easily. Another name of the unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa),
when 1 N force is applied on an area of 1 m®> we get 1 Pa (1 Pascal) pressure.
5.2 Density
We need to have a clear idea about density before understanding pressure of
liquids and gases. Density is the amount of mass per unit volume, i.e. if mass of
a body is m and volume is 7, then density is:

Unit of density: kg/m* or gm/cc we ensity of some substances
Dimension of density: [P] = ML™® substances density

Density of some familiar substances is
given in table 5.01. Here is a good thing
to remember, if temperature increases
