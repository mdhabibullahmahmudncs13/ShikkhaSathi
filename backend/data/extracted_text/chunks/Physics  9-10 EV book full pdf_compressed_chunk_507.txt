Effect of Heat on Matter 175
equation and it is:
PV =nRT
Here P is pressure, Vis volume, is the amount of gas (measured in mole), R is
a constant (8.314 JK" mol") and 7 is temperature in Kelvin scale.
Now we can find out the co-efficient of expansion of a gas. At a certain pressure
if the volume of a gas is V/, at temperature 7’ and the volume is V, at temperature
T, the co-efficient of volume expansion B of the gas will be:
PERUSAL
’ T,=T
‘We know,
PV, = nRT,
PV, = nRT,
Hence
PV, — V1) =nR(T, — Ty)
Dividing the left side by PV, and the right side by nRT, we get:
Vo-V T,-T
[A
So, Caz VO _ 1
T,=T Ty
That is 2
: =7
Therefore, you can see that the co-efficients of expansion of gases are not
constants at all. It is reciprocal to the temperature (7), i.e., the less the
