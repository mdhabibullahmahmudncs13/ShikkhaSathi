Example 1. Explain whether the following systems of equations are consistent
inconsistent, dependent/ independent of each other and indicate the number of
solutions in each case.
1) z+3y=1 2) 20—5y=3 3) 3x —5y="7
2r + 6y =2 x+3y=1 6x — 10y = 15
Solution:
. Cor +3y=1
1) Given system of equations is:
2x4 6y =2
. 1
Ratio of the coefficients of x is 3
. _- 3]
Ratio of the coefficients of y is 5 or, 5
. 1
Ratio of constant terms is 2
S13 1
26 2
Therefore, the system of equations is consistent and mutually dependent.
The system of equations has infinite number of solutions.
i . 2x —-5y=3
2) Given system of equations is:
z+3y=1
. i 2
Ratio of the coefficients of = is 1
-5
Ratio of the coefficients of x is 3
