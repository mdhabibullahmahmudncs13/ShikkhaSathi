‘Work: Make a right circular cylinder using a rectangular paper. Determine
the area of its whole surface and the volume.
Example 31. The outer measurements of a box with its top are 10 cm, 9 cm
and 7 cm respectively and the area of the whole inner surface is 262 square metre
and the thickness of its wall is uniform on all sides.
1) Find the volume of the box.
2) Find the thickness of its wall.
3) If the length of a diagonal of a rhombus having sides equal to the largest
length of the box is 16 cm, then find its area.
Solution:
1) The outer measurements of the box with top are 10 cm, 9 cm and 7 cm.
.. The outer volume of the box = 10 x 9 x 7 = 630 cube cm
2) Let, the thickness of the box is z. The outer measurements of the box with
top are 10 cm, 9 cm 7 cm.
