Chapter 12. Simple Simultaneous Equations in Two Variables 257
Taking some values of = in the equation, we find the corresponding values of y
and make the adjoining table:
yl —6]—4]1]
.-. three points on the graph of the equation are: (—1,—6), (0, —4), (4,4).
Again, from equation (2) we get,
4dr —2y = 12, or, 22 — y = 6 [dividing both sides by 2]
or,y=2r—6
Taking some values of = in the equation, we find the corresponding values of y
and make the adjoining table:
[y[-6]0]6]
.-. three points on the graph of the equation are: (0,6), (3,0), (6,6).
In a graph paper let XOX’ and YOY’ be
respectively the X- axis and Y- axis and O is Y
