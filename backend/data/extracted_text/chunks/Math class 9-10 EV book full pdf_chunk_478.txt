Chapter 9. Trigonometric Ratio 205

Again, when the angle 6 is very closed to 90°, hypotenuse OP is approximately
equal to PN. So the value of sinf is approximately 1.on the other hand, if the
angle 0 is equal to 90°, ON is nearly zero; the value of cos 0 is approximately 0.
So, in agreement of formulae that are described above, we can say, cos 90° = 0,
sin 90° = 1
cos 90° 0
$900 =
«0 Sn90° 1
1 1
cosec 90° = ——— =~ =1
cosee sm 90° 1
Since one cannot divided by 0 as before, tan 90° and sec 90° are not defined.
Note: For convenience of using the values of trigonometric ratios of the angles
0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90° are shown in the following table :
Ratio/Augld 0° | 30° [ 45° [ 60° | 90° |
