========================================

PR . . v, are the new velocities of masses
3 mu, where m is the mass and u is the mand m, respectively
velocity of the object. We assume that no / ’
other energy is exchanged here rather than
kinetic energy.
Therefore using the law of conservation of energy, we can write,
1 2, 1 21 2,1 2
Fm + Fmt =o mvi + 5 M23
@ Do Yourself
Using these two equations calculate the values of v and v,.
We can write the law of conservation of momentum as:
my (uy — vp) = my(vy — up)
The law of conservation of energy, we can be expressed as
my (uf — vf) = my (vi — ud)
Now using these two equations we can calculate the values of the velocities
v, and v,. These are:
_ (my —myluy + 2myuy
v= my +m,
(my — mu, + 2myuy
