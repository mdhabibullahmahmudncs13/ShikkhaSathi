Chapter 12. Simple Simultaneous Equations in Two Variables 261
Let the two straight lines intersect each other at P. It is seen from the picture
1
that the coordinates of P are (5 -3).
. 1
solution: (z,y) = 7 -3
. , 3
Example 11. Solve with the help of graphs: 3 — Pd =8—4x
. . Lo, 3
Solution: Given equation is 3 — Pid =8—4x
, 3
Let, y=3-go=8-dz
3
cy=3—gr...(1)
and y =8 — 4x... (2)
Taking some values of x in equation (1), we find the corresponding values of y
and make the adjoining table:
[o[-2f0]2]
[v[ 6 [3]0]
.". three points on the graph of the equation are: (—2,6), (0,3), (2,0).
Again, taking some values of 2 in equation (2), we find the corresponding values
of y and make the adjoining table:
