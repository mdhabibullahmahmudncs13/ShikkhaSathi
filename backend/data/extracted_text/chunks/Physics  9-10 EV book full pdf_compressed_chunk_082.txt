========================================

There is less probability for all of you to possess slide calipers
but if you want, you can make a slide calipers to carry on your work. Make a
photocopy of figure 1.10. Cut the part of the main scale and the vernier scale
and then put it together after folding as shown in the figure following the
steps (1,2, 3, ...... accordingly). Now you can measure any length accurately.
The slide calipers is also graduated in inch. So to get the length in centimeter
we need to multiply it with 2.54. 5
