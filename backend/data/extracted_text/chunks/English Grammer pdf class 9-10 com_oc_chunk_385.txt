========================================

inverted comma (“....") before and after the speech (made by other

than who is reporting).
When we report what someone js saying or thinking now we use indirect
speech after says, thinks, hopes etc. (as in Context2). Here we often use that
but that is not obligatory.
Example

We also use this form when we say about something that is always true.
eg. He says he doesn’t like band music.

Dipika says we can create a better world by loving each other.
