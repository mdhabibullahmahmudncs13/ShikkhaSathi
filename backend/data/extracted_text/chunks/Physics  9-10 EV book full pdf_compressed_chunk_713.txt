========================================

point X is drawn through the center point of the lens, it will go straight along XO
towards S. CFT and XOS will not meet going forward, which means there is no
chance of forming a real image. If the two lines are extended backward, they
will meet at point X', which is the image of X.
The normal which is drawn from the point X ‘on the line YF touches YF at the
point Y'. This is the image of point Y.
The closer the XY object is to the lens ,the bigger the image will be. The closer
the object is to the focal point F, the bigger the image will be. When the object
will be exactly on point F, the size of the image will be infinite. Now we can say,
if an object is kept between the center of the lens and the focal point of a convex
lens, the image of the object:
