========================================

At the time of evaporation, water absorbs the latent heat of vaporization; the
reverse process is also true. If vapors transform into water by any process then it
delivers heat. During a cyclone the air filled with water vapour goes upwards,
when the vapor transforms into water the latent heat of vaporization is released
as energy. This energy acts as the source of the devastating energy of a cyclone.
