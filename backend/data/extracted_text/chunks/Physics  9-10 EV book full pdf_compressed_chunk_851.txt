========================================

Since the amount of electrical energy supplied per second is VI, if the
potential is increased by 10 times, it is possible to supply the same energy using
10 times less current. If 10 times less current is supplied, 100 times less heat
energy will be dissipated. This is because the resistance R of the wire is the same
in both cases.
Now you may think that the loss of heat energy can also be written as /*/R and
in that case the heat energy loss will be 100 times due to 10 times increase of
voltage. It is to be remembered that when we found the energy loss per second
as V%/R, we then saw V was the potential difference between the two sides of the
resistance. The ¥ which we are discussing here is not the potential difference
