interior angles. ZACB is the adjacent interior angle 5 = D
of the exterior angle ZACD. Each of ZABC and
ZBAC is an opposite interior angle with respect to
ZACD.
Theorem 4. The sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to two right
angles.

Let ABC be a triangle. In the triangle ZBAC + ZABC + ZACB = 2 right angles.
Draw C'E from point C so that AB || CE. Now ZABC' = ZECD [corresponding
angles] and ZBAC = ZACE [alternate angles]
 LABC + ZBAC = ZECD + LACE = ZACD
ZABC + /BAC + ZACB = ZACD + ZACB = 2
right angles.
Corollary 2. If a side of a triangle is produced, then exterior angle so formed
is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles.
Corollary 3. If a side of a triangle is produced, the exterior angle so formed is
