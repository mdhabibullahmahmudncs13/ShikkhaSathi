2. A girl of mass 50 kg has gone up the .
stairs . a height of 5m 5 10 ow ouch Figure 4.07: Graph of velocity-time
work has she done? What is her power in
horse power?
3. When a force was applied on a stationary object of mass 5 kg for 10 s, its
kinetic energy became 500 J. Find the amount of force applied.
4. Two objects of masses 10 kg and 5 kg
are attached to the two sides of a pulley and A
is kept stationary 5 m above the ground. If —
you release the two objects, then the 10 kg Hn
mass starts to come down and the 5 kg Ti
starts to go up. When the mass 10 kg has semen
come down by 1 m and the mass 5 kg has ~ 1 im
gone up by 1 m, what are the velocities of AEE (———
the two masses? 1m
5. If a body of 5 kg is released from a J TTT
