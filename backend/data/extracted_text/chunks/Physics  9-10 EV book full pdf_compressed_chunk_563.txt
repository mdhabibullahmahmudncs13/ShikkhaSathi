========================================

wavelength. Wavelength is the distance from any phase of the wave to the next
identical phase (Figure 7.04). Therefore, the distance travelled by a wave in one
time period is the wavelength.
In waves there is a second quantity which is not present in simple harmonic
vibration, this is wave velocity. The distance travelled by a wave in one second
is called the wave velocity. The number of time periods present in one second is
the frequency, if the frequency is f'and wavelength is 2, then the velocity can be
expressed as,
v=fA
When a wave travels from one medium to another medium, then change of its
velocity occurs. Since the frequency always remains the same, so when a wave §
