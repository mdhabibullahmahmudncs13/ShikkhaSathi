that, PA = PB A c
Drawing: Join O, 4; O, B and O, P.
Proof:
Step 1. Since PA is a tangent and OA is the radius through the point of tangent,
PA LOA
o. ZPAO = 1 right angle. [The tangent is perpendicular to the
radius through the point of contact of the tangent]
Similarly, ZPBO = 1 right angle.
.APAO and APBO are right-angled triangles. i.

Step 2. Now in the right angled triangles APAO and APBO, S
