========================================

10(z +2) + x or, 11x + 20

By the question, 112 + 20 = 2(11z +2) — 6

or, Ile +20 = 22x +4 — 6

or, 22x — 11x = 20 4 6 — 4 [by transposition]

or, 11x = 22

or, x =2

the number is 112 +2 =11x2+2=24

.. given number is 24

Example 6. In a class if 4 students are seated in each bench, 3 benches remain
pS vacant. But if 3 students are seated on each bench, 6 students are to remain
