========================================

and properties of the space.
A solid occupies space which is spread in three directions. This spread in three
directions denotes the three dimensions (length, breadth and height) of the solid.
Hence every solid is three dimensional. For example, a brick or a box has three
dimensions (length, breadth and height). A sphere also has three dimensions.
Although the dimensions are not distinctly visible, it can be divided distinctly
into length-breadth-height.
NL (ay
The boundary of a solid denotes a surface, that is, every solid is bounded by one
or more surfaces. For example, the six faces of a box represent six surfaces. The
upper face of a sphere is also a surface. But the surfaces of a box and of a sphere
are different. The first one is plane while the second one is curved.
