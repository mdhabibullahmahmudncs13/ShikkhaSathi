========================================

A line segment is drawn through G parallel to DE which intersects AC" at
F. Prove that AC = 6EF.
6. In the triangle ABC, X is any point on BC' and O is a point on AX. Prove
that AAOB : AAOC = BX : XC
7. In the triangle ABC, the bisector of A intersects BC at D. A line segment
drawn parallel to BC intersects AB and AC at E and F respectively. Prove
that BD: DC = BE : CF.
8. If the heights of the equiangular triangles ABC and DEF are AM and DN
respectively, prove that AM : DN = AB: DE.
9. In the adjacent figure BC' || DE A
1) Prove that, ABOC and ADOE
are similar. D E
2) Prove that, AD: BD = AE: CE.
3) Prove that, BO : OE = CO: OD B C
Similarity
The congruence and similarity of triangles have been discussed earlier in class VIL.
