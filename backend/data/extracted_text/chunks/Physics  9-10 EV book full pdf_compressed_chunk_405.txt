5.3.2: Floatation and Immersion of a Body
You have surely understood why an object floats and why an other object is
immersed. You know an object experiences an upward force due to buoyancy
which is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the object when it is
immersed in water. The object will float if that force is greater than the weight of
the object.
Just the portion of the object which is immersed so that it will displace water
equal to the weight of the body, only that portion will be immersed exactly, the
remaining part will not be immersed in water.
If the weight of the body is greater than the weight of the displaced water the
body will sink in water. But it seems that the weight of the body when immersed
