========================================

sides of a triangle are given. Construct the triangle.
Let the base a, a base adjacent angle Zz and the sum s of the other two sides of
a triangle ABC be given. It is required to construct it.
Drawing:
1. From any ray BE cut the line segment BC'
equal to a. At B of the line segment BC,
draw an angle ZCBF = Zu. 7d
2. Cut a line segment BD equal to s from the LP a
G s—————
ray BF. A g
3. Join C, D and at C' make an angle ZDCG Za) Jd
equal to ZBDC on the side of DC in which a cE
B lies.
4. Let the ray CG intersect BD at A.
Then, AABC is the required triangle.
Proof: In AACD, ZADC = ZACD [by construction]
