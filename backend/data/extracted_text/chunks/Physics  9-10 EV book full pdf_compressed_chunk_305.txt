========================================

Multiplying both sides by im the equation becomes smu? = smu? + mas
If we write F instead of ma and W instead of Fis, then the equation becomes,

1 1

Fm? = Fm’ + Ww
That is, if an object moves with velocity u, then its kinetic energy is mu?
and if / amount of work is done on it, then its kinetic energy is increased to
