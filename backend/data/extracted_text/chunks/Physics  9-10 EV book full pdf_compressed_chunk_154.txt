========================================

v? =u? —2gh
v=0, u=41.67m/s, g = 9.8m/s?
ut (41.67)?
Therefore, =—=———"— m= 88.
erefore, h 29 2x98 m= 88.59 m
[The ball will approximately reach the roof of a 30 storied building]
Question: When a space ship revolves round the earth then its speed is very
high and is nearly 10 km/s. If a cannon ball is fired at this velocity straight upward,
how high will it go?
Answer: Let us try like with the cricket ball, only the initial velocity will be
10,000 m/s instead of 41.67 m/s.
10,000)?
Therefore, p= O00 102,000 m = 5,102 km
2x98
Though it is felt that there is no mistake anywhere but actually the answer is not
correct. This is because we have considered the value of acceleration due to
gravity is 9.8 m/s?, this is true for the distances near the surface of earth. But if
