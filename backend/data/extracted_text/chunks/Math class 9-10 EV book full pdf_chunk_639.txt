========================================

Example 5. What is the sum of first 30 terms of the series 7+ 12 + 17 +---?
Solution: First term of the series a = 7, common difference d = 12-7 =75
It is an arithmetic series. Here, number of terms n = 30
‘We know that the sum of first n-terms of an arithmetic series ,
S$, = 22a + (n—1)d}
So, the sum of 30 terms Szy = Dio S74 (30 —1)5} = 15(14 +29 x 5)
g = 15(14 + 145) = 15 x 159 = 2385
