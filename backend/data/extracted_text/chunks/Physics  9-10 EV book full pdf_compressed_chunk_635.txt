========================================

OP or ON ray), it will reflect perpendicularly and go back the way it has
come.
(ii) The ray parallel to the principal axis will go through the focal point (F) after
reflection (QF).
(iii) If the direction of light ray is changed, it goes back the way it has come.
So a light ray (figure 8.22, FQ) going through the focus will reflect parallel
(QX) to the principal axis.
Now we can create image for concave mirrors.
At a distance less than focal length
In Fig 8.22, a concave mirror is shown. This mirror is part of a sphere whose
center is O, focal point of the mirror is F and we want to determine the image of
the object XY. Light coming from point Y reflects from point P of the concave
mirror and again goes through point Y towards point O. So it can be
