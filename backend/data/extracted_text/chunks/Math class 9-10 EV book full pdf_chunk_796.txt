3. Volume of the rectangular solid = length x width x height = abe
Example 28. The length, width and height of a rectangular solid are 25 cm,
20 cm and 15 em respectively. Determine its area of the whole surface, volume
and the length of the diagonal.
Solution: Let, the length of the rectangular solid is a = 25 cm, width b = 20
cm and height ¢ = 15 cm
.-. Area of the whole surface of the rectangular solid = 2(ab + be + ca)
=2(25 x 20 4 20 x 15 + 15 x 25) = 2350 square cm
