In the figure the line PQ intersects the straight lines
AB and CD at E and F respectively and E is

1) ZPEB = corresponding ZEFD or, 4 B

2) ZAEF = alternate ZEFD or, Cc F D

3) ZBEF + ZEFD = 2 right angles 7)
Therefore, the straight lines AB and C'D are parallel.
Corollary 1. The lines which are parallel to a given line are parallel to each
other.
Exercises 6.2

1. Define interior and exterior of an angle.

2. If there are three different points in a line, identify the angles in the figure.

3. Define adjacent angles and locate its sides.

4. Define with a figure of each: opposite angles, complementary angle,
