========================================

When discussing reflection, we learned that when perfect and total reflection
is needed, then instead of mirror a perfect transparent medium is
used, and a kind of reflection is made. This is called total internal
reflection. It is a very easy and exciting process. Here, light rays are sent
to a rarer medium from a denser medium using the refraction of light. We
know (and have used many times) that the law of refraction is
n, sing, =n,siné, ie if n, is greater than n, then 6, is greater than 6,.
Suppose you are sending a ray of light from a denser(n, ) medium to a rarer(n,)
medium (Figure 9.06).According to the laws of reflection and refraction some
amount of light will be reflected and some will be refracted . As 6, will be greater
