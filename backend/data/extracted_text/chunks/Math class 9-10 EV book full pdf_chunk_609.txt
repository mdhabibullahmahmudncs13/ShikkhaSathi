Chapter 12. Simple Simultaneous Equations in Two Variables 263
Formation of simultaneous equations from real
life problems and solution
In everyday life, there occur some such mathematical problems which are easier
to solve by forming equations. For this, from the condition or conditions of the
problem, two mathematical symbols, mostly the variables x, y are assumed for
two unknown expressions. Two equations are to be formed for determining the
values of those unknown expressions. If the two equations thus formed are solved,
values of the unknown quantities will be found.
Example 12. If 5 is added to the sum of the two digits of a number consisting
of two digits, the sum will be three times the digits of the tens place. Moreover,
