========================================

P =0.50m x 800 kgm x 9.8 Nkg! = 3,920 Nm?
For water,

P =0.50m x 1000 kgm? x 9.8 Nkg! = 4,900 N m?
For mercury,

P =0.50m x 13,600 kgm? x 9.8 Nkg'! = 666,40N m?
Question: At what depth of the liquids kerosene, water and mercury pressure
will be 1 atm ?
Answer: We know, for mercury pressure is latm at a depth of 76 cm. Density
of water is 13.6 times less than mercury, therefore depth of water will be 13.6
times more.
Therefore, depth for water: 76 cm x 13.6 = 1034 cm = 10.34 m
Density of kerosene is 0.8 times less than water, therefore depth for kerosene
will be 1/0.8=1.25 times more.
Therefore, depth for kerosene: 10.34 m x 1.25 = 12.92 m
