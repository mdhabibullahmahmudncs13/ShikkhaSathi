13.1.6 Cautions about Radioactivity

A high radioactive dose can cause many

problems in our body. When research started

about radioactivity, the scientists did not

know the bad effects of radioactivity. As a

result, scientists were attacked with many

diseases as they came close contact with

radioactivity. Due to working for a long time

with radioactive elements Marie Curie suffered

from leukemia and died. Radioactivity

decreases immunity against disease,

preventing capability of human and even
