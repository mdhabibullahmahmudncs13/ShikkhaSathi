========================================

p=mv
Here the mass is a scalar quantity, but the velocity is a vector, therefore the
momentum is a vector quantity. You may think that generally the mass of an
object does not change, so a change in momentum may occur only due to the
change in its velocity. But in a special case we may find that the velocity of the
object has not changed but due to the change of mass, change of its momentum
occurs. You may think, instead of defining a new term ‘momentum’, what was
the problem to always treat it as a product of mass and velocity? In general, it
does not create a big problem but in case of a ‘particle of light’ it may create
serious problems. A particle of light or a photon has no mass but it has
momentum! Compared to the mass and velocity momentum is a more
fundamental quantity.
