Motion 45
Science the velocity is changing every moment hence we cannot write the
equation s = vt but if we consider an average velocity then we can write
s=Vt
In the case of a uniformly accelerated
particle, the average velocity over a 2
specific time interval is equal to the veloc- = — =
ity at the midpoint of that interval. 3 v

mid time velocity of the initial and

final velocity.
Therefore the travelled distance is,

Inall the equations of motion we have already deduced the time 7 is present. We
can deduce another equation in which is absent.
Such as:
v=u+at

v?=(u + atf’=u? + 2uat + a*t*> = u* + 2a (ue + Fat?)
