Current Electricity 307
After writing in big font size, cover any of ¥, I or R with finger. The value of
the covered one will be obtained from the uncovered ones.
Answer: It is shown in fig 11.05.

Figure 11.05: Ohm’s law can be used by this figure. The value of the covered
quantity by the finger can be expressed by the two other quantities.
11.2.2 Resistance
Resistance is the obstacle to the flow of current. So the more the length of a
material L, the higher is the hindrance, and resistance.
Rox L
Again current can flow more easily through a wide path than through a narrow
path. So, the higher the cross sectional area 4 of a conductor, the lower is the
resistance.
