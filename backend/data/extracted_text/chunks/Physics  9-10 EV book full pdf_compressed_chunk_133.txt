========================================

Notice that, since the path is curved, if you go through this path your direction is
changing continuously. Therefore you can move with uniform speed through
this path but you cannot go with uniform velocity. If anything moves in a linear
motion along a straight line, only then uniform velocity or constant velocity is
possible.

0) Example

Question: Let us consider another example to understand the relation between
velocity and speed more clearly. Tie a small piece of stone with a string and
rotate it around head (figure 2.05). Does the stone move with uniform
velocity or with uniform speed? Or with uniform speed and uniform velocity?
Answer: If you think for a while you EE aN

will be able to understand that the ~~ i =
speed of the stone is not changing but". . i =
