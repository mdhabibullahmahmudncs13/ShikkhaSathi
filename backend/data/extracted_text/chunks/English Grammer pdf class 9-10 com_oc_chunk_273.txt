B The Compound Sentence
A compound sentence has two or more independent clauses but no
subordinate clauses.
The independent clauses are usually joined by some connecting or
linking wards such as, and, but, or, nor, for, yet, however, therefore, etc.
We can also join the independent clauses by using a semicolon.
Following are some examples of compound sentences:
| like jogging, but | like swimming better.

| wanted to go to the concert, but | didn’t get the ticket.
