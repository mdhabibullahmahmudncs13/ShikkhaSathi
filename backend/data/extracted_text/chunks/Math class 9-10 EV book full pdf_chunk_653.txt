General term of a Geometric series
Let the first term of a geometric series be a and common ratio be r. Then, of the
series
First term = a = ar'~! Second term = ar = ar*~!
Third term = ar? = ar’! Fourth term = ar® = ar*~!
nth term = ar"!
This nth term is called the general term of the geometric series. If the first term
of a geometric series a and the common ratio r are known, any term of the series
