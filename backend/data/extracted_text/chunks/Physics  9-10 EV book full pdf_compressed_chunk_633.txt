========================================

(divergent).

Example

Question: If we imagine a plane mirror as a spherical concave mirror, what will

be its focal distance?

Answer: Infinite!

We got the same answer in case of convex mirrors, which means when the focal

distance increases to infinity then both convex and concave mirrors turn into
.. plane mirrors! The focal distance is half of the radius in concave mirrors as in a
El convex mirror.
