If we can make such a condition that as soon as the electromagnet reaches the
next position, the current passing through the electromagnet is changed, then
just after reaching there, the bar magnet made of coil alternates its polarities,
F——
Figure 12.10: In an electric motor current is passed through an electromagnet
in such a way that it can rotate always.
i.e. its north pole becomes the south pole and the south pole becomes north pole.
So due to repulsion, it will try to move again, i.e. it will experience a rotational
force. It will try to reach the next stable position, but just after reaching there if
the direction of the current is again changed, it will not stop there. Rather, it will
