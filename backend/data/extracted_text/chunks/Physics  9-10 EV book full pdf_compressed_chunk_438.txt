Here, Y is a constant. The name of this constant is Young’s modulus. As strain
has no unit, the unit of Y is Nm Young’s modulus of some substances are given
in the table 5.02.

Question: How does the length of a substance change with the change of the value
of the Young’s modulus?
Answer: Rate of change of length
L—-Ly_ 1 3)
Ly Yu
Therefore, if 7/4 remains the same, the higher the value of Y is, change in length
will be less.
(ii) Let us consider, in normal condition a gas of volume Vis contained in a
cylinder.
Due to the application of pressure P, its volume is reduced to V (Figure 5.12).
Here P is the stress and the Strain is:  _y
