If any charge ¢ is brought in this electric field, then it will feel F force on it and
the magnitude of F will be,

F=Eq

As force F is a vector and charge q is a scalar, so, £ itself is a vector and its unit

is N/C. You will see, this topic is easier to explain with the help of electric fields.

Electric field cannot be seen, but to make it easy to understand, sometimes one

type of completely imaginary

lines are drawn, called the

electric lines of force (first

introduced by Michael —

Faraday). Our known world is 4

three dimensional, so the lines

of force will spread in all

directions. To show you, these . oo i

are drawn in a plane (Fig Figure 10.11: Lines of force diverges from

10.11). positive charge and converges into negative
