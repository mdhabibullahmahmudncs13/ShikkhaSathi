1. Faruque pulls a box of mass 4 kg on the floor with a constant force. The
frictional force between the box and the floor is 1.5 N. While pulling, the
box accelerates at 0.8 ms? Then the box is pulled with the same force on
a frictionless floor.

(a) What is a balanced force?

(b) Why is the frictional force generated?

(c) What is the force applied to the box in the first case?

(d) What is the change in acceleration in frictional and frictionless
floors? Explain mathematically.
