========================================

tionally repeat a statement or loop. The format of the continue statement is-
continue
The continue statement moves the programme pointer to the previous statement
or to the beginning of the loop. The continue statement cannot work directly
without if; elif; for, while ete. For this reason, the continue statement is usually
used to repeat a loop subject to the condition related to if, elif statements. In that
case the conitnue statement is executed if the value of the condition is true.
otherwise the compiler ignores the continue statement and executes the next
statement.
