========================================

+ Beware of detectable answer patterns.

3. Matching

There is no need of a separate reading text for matching. The question itself will have
a context after the texts in part A and part B are properly matched. The numbering of
texts in column A can be i. ii, iii, iv ..... and the texts in column B can be a, b,c, d........
Students only need to match the numbering in the two columns, e.g i, ii, iii, iv ete. (in
column Aj and a, b. c. d etc. (in column B). You can also use 3 columns with texts to
match.

4. Gap filling with or without clues
