.-. three points on the graph of the equation are: (—1,5), (0.3) (3,-3).
6 — 4x
Again, from equation (2) we get, 2y = 6 — 4x or, y = —
Taking some values of z in the equation, we find the corresponding values of y
and make the adjoining table:

In a graph paper let XOX’ and YOY’ be
respectively the X- axis and Y- axis and O is
the origin.
We take each side of the smallest squares of the graph y
