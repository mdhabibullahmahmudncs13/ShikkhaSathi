========================================

£7 (3.84 x 105)?
Two forces must be equal for reducing gravity by Coulomb force.
That is Fy = Fy

q=5.69x10%C
Therefore, the number of electrons,

The mass of an electron is 9.11 x 10731 kg, so the mass of all electrons:
(3.56 x 1032) x (9.11 x 10731) kg = 324 kg
So, if we can keep 324 kg electrons both in earth surface and in moon, the moon
would come out of its orbit. (The mass of a moderate cow!)
10.5 Electric Field
The force between two charges can be determined by using Coulomb's formula.
You may remember, for gravitational force, we have determined gravitational
acceleration without beginning from gravitational force separately. Multiplying
