1.5.3 Dimension
We already know that though there is an infinite number of quantities around
us, we can measure them with the help of seven units only. We have to know, in
which units a quantity can be expressed. Often we also need to know how this
quantity is formed with which fundamental quantities (length L, time 7, mass M
etc.). The power of different fundamental quantities in a quantity is called its
dimension. For example, we will see next that force is the product of mass and
acceleration. Again, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time. And
velocity is the rate of change of position with time.
Therefore,
