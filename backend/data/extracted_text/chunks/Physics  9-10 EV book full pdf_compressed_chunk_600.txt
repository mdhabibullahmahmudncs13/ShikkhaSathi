Hold a CD in the sunlight and reflect the light on a nearby wall. You can see
the full spectrum of light on the wall. CDs have sharp indentations which
work as grating and separate the colors.
In Figure 8.01, the name of different wavelengths is shown. If the wavelength is
less than the smallest wavelength of visible light, then we call it ultraviolet light.
If the wavelength is even smaller than it is called x-ray, and even smaller is
called gamma ray- which comes out from radioactive nucleus. If the wavelength
is larger than the largest wavelength of visible light, we call it an infrared ray. If
it gradually becomes larger we call them microwave, and then radio waves! To
learn physics this division of wavelengths is one of the most important topics.
