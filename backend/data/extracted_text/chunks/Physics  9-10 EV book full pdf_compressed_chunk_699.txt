the concave lens is thinner than the edges as shown in 9.14. If we see the cross
section of the concave or convex lens we can understand that both are bound
with two round circles. The radius of these two circles can be different or the
same. The centers of these circles are called the centres of curvature. In the
picture 9.15, C, and C, are the centres of curvature.
Different kinds of lenses are used in everyday life or in different subjects of
science.

Figure 9.15: Convex and concave lens can be imagined as the part of two
circles.
We will keep our discussion limited to
thin lenses. Though the difference
between thin and thick lenses can be
understood by their names, let us
explain this more. Looking at the cross
