b the series — nt 27 11
So, the general term of the series = 128 x 5 =n TC gii7 gis
Example 9. first and the second terms of a geometric series are 27 and 9.
Find the 5th and the 10th terms of the series.
Solution: The first term of the given series a = 27, the second term = 9

Determination of the sum of a Geometric series
Let the first term of the geometric series be a, common ratio r and number of
terms n. If S,, is the sum of n terms,
Sy =atartar’ +a" Fam (1)
and r+ S, = ar + ar’ +ar® + +a" + ar” [multiplying (1) by r |... (2)
Subtracting, S, — rS, =a — ar"
or, Sp(1—7r)=a(l —r")
