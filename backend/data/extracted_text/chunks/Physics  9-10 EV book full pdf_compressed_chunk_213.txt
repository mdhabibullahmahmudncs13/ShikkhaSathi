========================================

If more than one object are in motion and they are moving at different velocities, EB

then they have a combined momentum. Due to different velocities of the objects,

they may collide with one another in their path of motion and due to the

collisions their velocities may change. If no force is applied from outside, then

after the collision the combined momentum will not change. This statement

is defined as the law of conservation of momentum.

0) Example

Question: If you throw a tennis ball at a wall with a velocity of 10 m/s, it will

bounce back towards you with the same speed. If the mass of the ball is 100 gm,

what is the change of momentum?

Answer: when the ball is thrown, then the momentum is p = mv. After striking
