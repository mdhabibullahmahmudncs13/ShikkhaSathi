========================================

atoms of phosphorus. This electron behaves like free electrons by making the
phosphorus atom a positive ion. It can be said that such phosphorus adding
semiconductors act as conductors to a large extent, because there are some free
electrons here to carry charges. The semiconductors made by mixing atoms
having five electrons in the outer most shell like phosphorus are called n type
semiconductors.
Now get ready to hear something more interesting. Instead of adding pentavalent
impurity atoms, if we add atoms having three electrons (e.g. boron) in their outer
most shells, to silicon, what will happen? Certainly, it is understood that there is
an empty space in the orbit of a boron atom and this empty place can be occupied
by a neighboring electron. Then an empty place will be created in the
