Waves and Sound 195
When a wave propagates through a spring, the wave moves forward by
contraction and expansion of the spring. Again by shaking one end of a rope a
wave can be formed and can be sent through the rope. There is a fundamental
difference between the two waves. The wave formed in the spring was of
contraction and expansion, the direction of contraction and expansion of the
spring and the direction of wave is the same. The name of this wave is longitudi-
nal wave. Sound (Figure 7.04) is this type of a longitudinal wave.
