3. Now try to measure the speed of a bicycle, rickshaw, tempo or a
pedestrian staying at a safe distance beside the road. Since the distance is
known, you can measure the required time, then speed can be calculated.
4. To measure the time accurately a stop watch is required, or an ordinary
watch will meet up the purpose instead of a stop watch. If you have none,
you can use an easy method to measure the time. It takes almost one
second to utter the words “one thousand one”, “one thousand two”, “one
thousand three” etc. Counting like this we can measure it.
5. When you will see a cycle, rickshaw, tempo or a pedestrian just passing
the first stationary object, you start to count time with a watch, or start
counting “one thousand one”, “one thousand two” and so on. Again when
