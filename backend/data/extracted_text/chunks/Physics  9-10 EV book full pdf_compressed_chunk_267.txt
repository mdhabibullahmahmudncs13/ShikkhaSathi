of a cycle, it presses the wheel and ceases the motion of the rotating wheel due
to kinetic friction. The kinetic friction depends on the weight of the moving
body, the more the weight, the more the kinetic friction. If an object has a mass
M, then its weight W= Mg is a force. Then the kinetic friction can be written as,
f= uW, u is the coefficient of kinetic friction.
Rolling friction: When an object moves by rolling or revolving on a surface
then the friction that develops is called the rolling friction. Among all the
frictional forces, this is the least, so we attach wheels on all kind of vehicles. It
is very easy to pull suitcases attached with wheels, if suitcases have no
wheels, it would become very difficult for us to pull it on the floor.
