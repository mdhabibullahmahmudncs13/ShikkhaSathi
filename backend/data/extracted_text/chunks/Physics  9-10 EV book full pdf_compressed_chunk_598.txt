Wavelength (nm)
Figure 8.01: Spectrum of light and sensitivity of eyes to different colors
Light is an electromagnetic and periodic wave. Every periodic wave has a wavelength,
which means light also has a wavelength. Those of us who have produced waves by
throwing a stone in a pond or by shaking a rope know that we can create waves of
different wavelengths if we desire. So light may have different wavelengths.
Electromagnetic waves may have any wavelengths.
These wavelengths may be greater than a few kilometers or may be one trillionth parts
of one meter. (1trillion=10'2) We can only see a small part of this large range of this.
