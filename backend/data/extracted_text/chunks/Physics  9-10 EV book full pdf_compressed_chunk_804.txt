========================================

TQ
A battery cell or a generator which supplies electric energy has an
electromotive force or emf. When a battery cell or a generator is connected
to a circuit, this electromotive force brings the charge through the whole
circuit.
The amount of potential a battery +15V -15V
produces is its electromotive force or emf. i |
In English it is called “force” but in
Bengali it is “energy”. Actually, this emf 1 1
or electromotive force is not force or allie 1
energy at all. We said earlier that in i) ho
physics terms like “force” and “energy” @ )
are very specific. We cannot use one word Figure 11.02: It is possible to
instead of the other. Unfortunately this make positive and negative
