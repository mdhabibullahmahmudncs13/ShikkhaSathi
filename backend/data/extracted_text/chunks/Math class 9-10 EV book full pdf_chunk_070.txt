infinite sets.
Example 4. Prove that the set of all natural numbers is an infinite set.
Solution: Suppose the set of natural numbers N is a finite set. Then this set
must have a maximum element K, where KEN. However, according to the
concept of natural numbers, if K is a natural number, then K+1 is also a
natural number which is greater than K. Therefore, K+1 must be an element
of the set of natural numbers N, i.e., K+1€N. s
