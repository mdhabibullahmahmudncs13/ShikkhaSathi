306 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Observe also that every object occupies same position after one complete
revolution. So every geometrical object has a rotational symmetry of order 1.
For finding the rotational symmetry of an object, one needs to consider the
following matter.
1) The centre of rotation
2) The angle of rotation
3) The direction of rotation
4) The order of rotational symmetry
‘Work:
1) Give examples of 5 plane objects from your surroundings which have
rotational symmetry.
2) Find the order of rotational symmetry of the following figures.

Line symmetry and rotational symmetry
We have seen that some geometrical shapes have only line symmetry, some have
only rotational symmetry and some have both line symmetry and rotational
