out roughly in the same direction, there is no deviation .
In the case of those lenses in which light ray passing through it, the direction of
the ray remains unchanged is called a thin lens. (Figure 9.17). We can say that
the point of the middle of a thin lens through which light rays do not deviate
when passing through it is called the center of that lens (Figure 9.17, point O)
or the Optical center.

Figure 9.17: When passing through a thick lens rays of light deviate a little;
when passing through a thin lens light rays do not change direction.

While discussing about convex and Nal ’
concave mirrors, we first learned | a
about convex mirrors. In the case of =
