========================================

2) /3 and £6, Z4 and Z5 are alternate angles.

3) Z4, Z6 are interior angles on the right.

4) £3, £5 are interior angles on the left.

In a plane two straight lines may intersect or they are parallel. The lines intersect
if there exists a point which is common to both lines. Otherwise, the lines are
parallel. Note that two different straight lines may at most have only one point
in common.

The parallelism of two straight lines in a plane may be defined in three different
ways:

1) The two straight lines never intersect each other ( even if extended to

infinity).

2) Every point on one line lies at equal smallest distance from the other.
