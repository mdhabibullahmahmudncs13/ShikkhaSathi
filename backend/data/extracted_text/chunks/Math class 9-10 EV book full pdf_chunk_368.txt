Construction of Quadrilaterals
We have seen if three independent data are given, in many cases it is possible
to construct a definite triangle. But with four given sides the construction of
a definite quadrilateral is not possible. Five independent data are required for
construction of a definite quadrilateral. A definite quadrilateral can be constructed
if any one of the following combinations of data is known :
1. Four sides and an angle
2. Four sides and a diagonal
3. Three sides and two diagonals
4. Three sides and two included angles
5. Two sides and three angles.
In class VIII, the construction of quadrilaterals with the above specified data has
been discussed. If we closely look at the steps of construction, we see that in some
