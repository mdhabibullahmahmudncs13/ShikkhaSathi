========================================

main scale, is not the reading of main scale, the mark that has just crossed
the main scale fully is the main scale reading.
3. At this position find out which mark of the vernier scale coincides with
any mark of the main scale, this is the vernier coincidence.
Measure the length of the object several times and put it in the table.
In the same way measure the breadth and height of the object.
Observation:
Determination of vernier constant:
Value of one smallest division of main scale, S = .................
Total number of divisions of vernier scale, n= ...............
Vernier constant, VC = s/n=..............
