0 it cannot be influenced by an

electric or magnetic field. Because it is charge less, it cannot directly ionize

atoms or molecules, but the electrons can ionize atoms or molecules in different

processes and from that we can understand the presence of gamma ray. To stop

gamma rays with energy equal to that of alpha and beta particles, a thick layer of

lead of several centimeters is needed.

13.1.4 Half Life

It is not possible to say the exact moment when a definite radioactive nucleus

will emit radioactive rays. Physics can only predict the probability of its

radiation. So the concept of Half Life is used to determine the amount of

radioactivity. The time in which half of the nucleus disintegrates (or radiates) is
