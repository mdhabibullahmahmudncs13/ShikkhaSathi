========================================

F. a e = A
FO=FY because in the triangle OFY,

ZFOY=Z0YF , as FOY= 0; and

ZFYO=6,.

FY = FX when XY is small compared

to radius r. This is true for most Figure 8.18: A spherical convex mirror
convex mirrors. is a small part of a hollow sphere.
So, FO=FY=FX= 1/2

or focal length f= 1/2

Question: If a plane mirror is considered a spherical convex mirror then
what is its focal length?

Answer: Infinite.

We will now see how the image is formed for a spherical mirror. You will see
that in a convex spherical mirror, images are always virtual where as in a
spherical concave mirror it may be both real or virtual, depending on the position
of the object.
