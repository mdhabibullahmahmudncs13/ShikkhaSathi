Current Electricity 323
flows through equipment is passed through a thin wire before entering the
equipment. The thin wire (where the resistance is more, so °R is more i.e. more
heat) of the fuse becomes heated and burnt, and stops the supply of electricity if
for any reason excess current tries to flow.
(e)Flow less connection: There are always two wires in an electric supply line,
one with high potential (Live) and another is voltage less neutral (Neutral).

When a machine is used, then starting from the live wire the electricity passes
through the machine and then returns to the source through the neutral
