Appendix 409
Here, putting y=2 in equation (3) we get,
x=2+3
Sox=5
.. Required solution is (x, y) = (5, 2).
[Verification : If we put x=5and y=2 in both the equations, L.H.S of
(1)is5+2=7 =RH.Sand LH.S of (2) 5-2=3 =RH.S]
Example 2. Solve the equations
x+2y=9
2x-y=3
Solution : The given equations are
X+2y=9.(l)
2x—y=3.(2)
From 2) we get y = 2x -3.....(3)
Putting the value of in equation (1) we get, x + 2(2x -3) =9
or, x+4x-6=9
or, Sx=6+9
or, 5x =15
15
or, xX =—
5
Sox =3
Now putting the value of Xin (3) we get,
y=2x3-3
=6-3
=3
~. Required solution : (x, y) = (3,3).
Example 3 . Solve the equations
2y+52=16
y—2z=-1
