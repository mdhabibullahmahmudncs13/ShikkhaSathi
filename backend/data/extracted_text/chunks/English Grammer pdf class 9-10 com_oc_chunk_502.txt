========================================

Cc Read the following paragraph and notice how the topic sentence
expresses the main idea of the topic, i.e. my little sister acts like my big
sister. And then notice how this is developed through illustrations or
examples in the following sentences:

My little sister might as well be called my big sister. I'm twenty years old,
and Urmila is only twelve. But Urmila acts like a sixty year old lady, not
only with me but with everyone else in the house. She is regularly
advising my father on what to wear, what to eat, when to take rest. My
mother merely smiles when Urmila advises her on what to cook for the
day or if the curry was a little too salty. Maybe we all pamper her a little,
