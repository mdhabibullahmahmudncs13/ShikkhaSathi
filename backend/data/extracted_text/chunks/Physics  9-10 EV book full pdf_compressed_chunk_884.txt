========================================

direction of the magnetic field, while the other fingers show the direction of the

current (Figure 12.06). A coil of wire or a solenoid behaves like a bar magnet,

and the direction of the thumb will be the north pole of this magnet.

12.2.2: Electromagnet

A more powerful magnetic field can be created if a piece of iron is inserted

inside a solenoid than the magnetic field that can be produced by using current

only. The three metals iron, cobalt and nickel have special magnetic properties.

These metallic pieces can be considered as an accumulation of individual tiny

magnets, which generally don’t act as a magnet as they are aligned in different

directions. These substances consist of an enormous number of small
