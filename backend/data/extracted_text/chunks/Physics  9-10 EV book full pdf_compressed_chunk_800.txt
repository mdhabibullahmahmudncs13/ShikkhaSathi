========================================

You can understand that electricity flows only if there is a potential
difference. If we want to get a continuous flow of electricity, we have to
always maintain a potential difference and cannot let it be equal. If
potential is created using a positive charge in a sphere and then connecting
it with another uncharged sphere (Figure 11.01) by a metal wire, as the
electricity starts flowing, the potential difference will start decreasing and
the potentials will become equal! It is possible to develop a potential
difference between the two plates of a capacitor by accumulating charges
there. But if the plates of the capacitor are connected with a wire, the
potentials will become equal due to flow of charge.
So you can understand that if we want a continuous flow of electricity, we
