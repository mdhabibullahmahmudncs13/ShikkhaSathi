Chapter 8. Circle 165
Interior and Exterior of a Circle
If O is the centre of a circle and 7 is its radius, the set
of all points on the plane whose distances from O are
less than 7 is called the interior region of the circle
and the set of all points on the plane whose distances
from O are greater than r is called the exterior region R Q
of the circle. The line segment joining two points of
a circle lies inside the circle.
The line segment drawn from an interior point to an exterior point of a circle
intersects a circle at one and only one point. In the figure, P is the interior point
and @Q is the exterior point of the circle. The line segment PQ intersects the circle
at R only.
