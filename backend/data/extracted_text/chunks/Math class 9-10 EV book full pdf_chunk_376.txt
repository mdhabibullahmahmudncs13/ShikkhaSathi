ZABZ equal to Zy.
Now from the line segment AB, cut a line segment AE = b. At E, construct
EC'|| AY which cuts BZ at C. Now construct C'D || BA. The line segment C'D
intersects the ray AY at D. Then, ABCD is the required trapezium.
Proof: By construction, AE || CD and AD || EC. Therefore AECD is a
parallelogram and CD = AE = b.
Now in the quadrilateral ABCD, AB = a, CD =b, AB || CD and ZBAD =
Lx, LABC = Zy [by construction]
Therefore, ABC'D is the required trapezium.
‘Work: The perimeter and an angle of a rhombus are given. Construct the
rhombus.
Example 4. In the triangle ABC, ZB = 60°, ZC = 45° and perimeter p = 13
cm.
1) Construct ZB and ZC with scale and compass.
