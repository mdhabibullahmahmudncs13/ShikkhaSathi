========================================

Oersted showed that magnets can be made by the flow of electricity. In
1831 Faraday invented just the opposite process given by Oersted. They showed
that electricity can be produced by varying the magnetic field. In 1864 Maxwell
(Figure 1.03) expressed the varying electric and magnetic fields with a single
law, the famous Maxwell equation. Here, he also showed that actually light is an
electromagnetic wave. Electricity and magnets are not different. In fact they are
the two forms of the same energy. This invention was well-timed because in
1801 Young proved the wave nature of light through experiments.
1.3.3. Introduction to Modern Physics
From the very beginning of 19th century scientists felt that many things
could not be explained with the help of existing physics. Dalton introduced
