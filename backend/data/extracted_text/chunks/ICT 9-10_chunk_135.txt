You have to reduce the number of unknown friends from your social networking
site to reduce your addiction. You have to convince yourself that you can surf the
sites after completing the important jobs. You have lo develop the habit of
deactivating social networking sites when you have exams or other important
events. You will gradually reduce the addiction in this way, and finaly get rid of
it completely.

You should remember that every moment of your life is valuable, and it is
unwise to spend these moments for any addiction.
