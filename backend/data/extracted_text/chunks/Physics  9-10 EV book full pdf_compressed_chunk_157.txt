Determination of velocity and acceleration at any time from a time-
distance graph.
(Motion and Graph)
‘We have deduced equations of motion in the previous sections. We have
analyzed the relations between distance travelled, velocity and
acceleration. In this section we will analyze the same quantities but only by
graph. We can have a kind of real feelings about different quantities of
motion, if we analyze them graphically.
