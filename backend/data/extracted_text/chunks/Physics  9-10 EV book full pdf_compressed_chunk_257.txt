========================================

understanding this, they may be remind- force on him in contrary
ed that it is easier walking on hard
ground compared to sandy ground. The reason is that it is not possible to apply
force on the sand, sand is displaced. Therefore the reaction force in Newton's
third law cannot be achieved properly. The matter can be clarified more, if one
is allowed to walk on a very smooth surface lubricated with soap-water or oil!
There friction is hardly present so we cannot apply a backward force at all and
due to this we will not get any force on us as the reaction force. So we cannot
walk at all (You may try if you don’t believe it). If force is applied, equal and
opposite force is found, but if we cannot apply force at all, how can we get a
reaction force? Then how can we walk?
