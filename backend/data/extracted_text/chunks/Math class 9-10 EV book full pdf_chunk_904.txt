Quadrilateral
A quadrilateral is a closed figure bounded by four line B
segments. The closed region is also known as
quadrilateral. The quadrilateral has four sides. The four
line segments by which the region is bounded, are the » c
sides of the quadrilateral.
In the figure any three points of the points 4, B, C, D are not collinear. The
quadrilateral ABCD is constructed by the four line segments AB, BC, CD and DA.
The points 4, B, C and D are the vertices of the quadrilateral. Z4BC, ZBCD,
