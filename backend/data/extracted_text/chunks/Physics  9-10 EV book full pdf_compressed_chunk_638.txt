========================================

cannot be an image formed on the right side. But if we are able to look at the left
side from the right side then it will look like line ON and line FQ coincide at X'
point- so X’ will be the image of X. If we draw a perpendicular from this point
on OP axis then we will get X'Y" which is the full image of XY. No light is
coming from X'Y’, only we are thinking that the image is being formed there. So
this image is a virtual image. We can see from the figure that the image is larger
than the object. Not only will the image be larger but moving the object closer to
the focal point will create a yet larger image. (If the object is placed just on the
focal point then the reflected rays will become parallel meaning that the light
rays won't be able to coincide to create an image.)
