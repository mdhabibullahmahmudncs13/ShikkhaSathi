Summary Conventions

« Summaries can range in length from two sentences to several pages.
What you have to remember is that when you write a summary of
something you have read, you make your summary shorter than the
original. Usually a summary is one third of the original in length, i.e. if a
passage is of 150 words, the summary of it would be about 50 words
long.

« In any case, use complete sentences to present the main points or
information the text you are describe an author's general points to the
reader. Don't quote extensively. If you quote, use quotation marks and
document the quotation. If you fail to document the quotation, even
one word that the author used, you are plagiarizing material
(presenting another person's information as if it were your own).
