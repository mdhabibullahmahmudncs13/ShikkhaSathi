========================================

point of intersection. From FE, perpendicular FH is

drawn on BC and let EH intersects BC at H. With

FE as centre and radius equal to EH, a circle is drawn. A BG D

The circle FIG L is the ex-circle of the triangle ABC.

Proof: From E, perpendiculars EG and EL respectively are drawn to line

segments BD and CF.Let the perpendicular intersect line segments BD and

C'F at the point G and L respectively.

Since E lies on the bisector of ZDBC' -. EH = EG

Similarly, the point FE lies on the bisector of ZFCB, so, EH = EL

EH =FEG=EL

Hence, the circle drawn with E as centre and radius equal to E'L passes through

H, Gand L.

Again, the line segments BC, BD and C'F respectively are perpendiculars at the

extremities of EH, EG and EL.
