type, which can be performed by using an interesting scale called vernier scale.

Let us consider that the length of an object comes in between
4 and 5 millimeter marking i.e. the length of the object is greater than 4 mm and
less than 5 mm. We can use the veriner scale to find how much fraction is greater
than 4 mm. This scale is attached to the main scale and can be moved forward
and backward (Figure 1.05). In the example shown in the figure the length of 9
mm of main scale is divided into 10 divisions on the vernier scale. Therefore every
division of the vernier scale equals = mm, i.e. less than a millimeter by =
millimeter. If the initial mark of the vernier scale coincides with any mark of the
