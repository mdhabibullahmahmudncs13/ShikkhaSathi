thin lenses. Though the difference
between thin and thick lenses can be
understood by their names, let us
explain this more. Looking at the cross

section of the lens, we can see that direction
though the lens has a curvature in the
surface, at the middle the two surfaces
are almost parallel. We know when light
passes through a parallel surface it is ofiginal ray
deviated a little from the main direction

As the parallel surface thickens, the from main rays due to refraction.
rays of light will deviate more. If the
parallel surfaces are close to each other
,we can say that main rays of light go
