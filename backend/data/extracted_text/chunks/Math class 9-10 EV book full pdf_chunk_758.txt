Chapter 16. Mensuration 329
or, 22 — 50 + 402 — 2000 = 0 or, (x — 50)(z + 40) = 0

cox =50 or, x = —40

But length can never be negative. .-, x = 50

Now putting the value of z in equation (2) we get, y = 50 — 10 = 40

.. The length of the rectangular is 50 and breadth 40 metre.

Example 10. There is a road of 4 metre width inside around a square field.
If the area of the road is 1 hector, determine the area of the field excluding the
road.

Solution: Let, the length of the square field is 2 metre.

Its area is 2? sq. metre

There is a road around the field with width 4 metre. xm

Length of the square field excluding the road = (z—2x4) im

or, (x — 8) metre.

Area of the square field excluding the road is = (x — 8)?

sq. metre

Area of the road = 2? — (z — 8)? sq. metre
