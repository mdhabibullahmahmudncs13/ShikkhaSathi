Construction 6. To determine the centre of a circle or an arc of a circle.
Given a circle as in figure (a) or an arc of a circle as
in figure (b). It is required to determine the centre of
the circle or the arc.
Drawing: In the given circle or the arc of the circle,
three different points A, B and C are taken.
Join A, B and B, C'. The perpendicular bisectors J
EF and GH of the chords AB and BC are drawn
respectively. Let the bisectors intersect at (. (Circle ©): Are
Threfore, the O is the required centre of the circle Cc
or of the arc of the circle.
Proof: By construction, the line segment EF is the A
perpendicular bisector of chord AB and GH is the A B
perpendicular bisector of chord BC. But both EF x
