1. Velocity is zero but acceleration is not zero —is it possible? If possible,

explain.

2. Velocity is changing but speed is not changing. Is it possible? If possible show
it.

3. The acceleration due to gravity on the moon is 6 times less than that of earth.
If a stone is released from a definite height towards earth, at which velocity it
will hit the ground, if the same stone is released from the same height.

4. Ts there any place from where you go 1 km south and then 1 km east,
continuing 1 km north will you reach the same place?

5.Do we travel double the distance at double the time in case of uniform
acceleration?
