========================================

|£0.5 mm| = 0.5 mm

‘We can consider the relative error after the absolute error. Let us consider that an
error of 0.5 mm has occurred while measuning length. If the length of the object
is 1 mm then this error is very serious, but if the length is 1 m then the
measurement is accurate enough. The concept of relative error has been
introduced to give a better understanding.
Therefore, . Absolute error

Relative error = —————

Measured value

So in our previous example:

Relative error: 0.5 mm/ 7 mm = 0.071
