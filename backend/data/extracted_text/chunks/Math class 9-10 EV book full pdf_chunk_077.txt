Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 27
Solution: Given , P = {x : x is a factor of 12 }
Here, factors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12
oP ={1,2.3,4,612}
Again, Q = {x : 3 is a factor of z and = < 12}
Here, multiples of 3 up to 12 are 3,6,9,12
-.Q=1{3,6,9,12}
SL P—Q=1{1,2,34,612} — {3,6,9,12} = {1,2,4}
The required set is: {1,2,4}
Universal Set
All sets under discussion are subsets of a definite set. For example: the set
A = {x,y} is a subset of the set B = {x,y,z} Here, B set is called as universal
set with respect to set A.
So if all sets under discussion are subsets of a given set, then the later set is said
to be universal set with respect to sets under discussion.
Usually universal set is denoted by U. However, other symbols can also be used
