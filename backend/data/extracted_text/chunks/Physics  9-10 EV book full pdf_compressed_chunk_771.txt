========================================

This illustrates that the voltage difference is what truly matters, not the absolute
value of the voltage itself—a vital concept for everyone to understand.
However, when it comes to measuring voltage levels, it is useful to have a
specific reference voltage. In everyday life, we consider the Earth to have zero
potential. The Earth is so immense that adding or removing a small amount of
charge does not affect its potential. Consequently, all measurements are made
relative to this zero potential. You may have noticed that heavy electrical equip-
ment is consistently well-grounded (Earthing). This grounding ensures that if a
significant amount of charge unexpectedly enters the system—due to an acci-
dent, for example—it can quickly and safely discharge into the ground, minimiz-
