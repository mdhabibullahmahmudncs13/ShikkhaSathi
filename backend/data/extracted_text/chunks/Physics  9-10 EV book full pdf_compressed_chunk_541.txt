To understand physics perfectly we need have a clear idea about some topics, one of
them is wave. In this chapter we shall limit our discussions to several types of
mechanical waves which are known to us.
Sound is one kind of a wave. In our daily lives, sound plays a very important
role, so we shall discuss sound, velocity of sound, echo and sound pollution in
this chapter.
