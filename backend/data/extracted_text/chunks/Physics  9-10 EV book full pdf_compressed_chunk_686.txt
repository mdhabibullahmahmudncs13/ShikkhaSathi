In this case if the critical angle is,
. 1
sing, = Tas = 0.69
0, = 43.6°
Therefore, if light incidents at angle 75°, then total internal reflection will happen
instead of reflection.
9.2.1 Rainbow
You may be thinking that you have never seen total internal reflection. But those
who have seen a rainbow have seen total internal reflection . A rainbow is
formed by the total internal reflection of water. Those who have not separated
white light into different colors with prism , have seen this in a rainbow . If the
sun shines after rain, we see a rainbow. Because there are water droplets in the
air, in that water total internal reflection occurs, where different colors of light
bends in different angles . The bands of different color of the rainbow are formed
