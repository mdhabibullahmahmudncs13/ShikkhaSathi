========================================

(b) Cube
If the side of a cube is a unit, then area of each of the six faces of the
cube=a x a sq. unit = a? sq. unit.
Therefore, area of the whole faces of the cube = 6a? sq. unit.
Example : The length, the breadth and the height of a rectangular solid are
respectively 7.5 cm, 6 cm and 4 cm. Find the area of the entire faces of the solid.
Solution : We know, if the length, the breadth and the height of a solid are
respectively a unit, b unit and c unit, then the area of the entire faces of the
solid = 2(ab + bc + ac) sq. unit.
Here,a=7.5cm,b=6 cm, c=4.
