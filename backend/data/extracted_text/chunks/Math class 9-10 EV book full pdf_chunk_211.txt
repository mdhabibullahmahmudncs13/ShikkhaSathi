Corollary 1. log,b= Toga or, log,a = Tos
Proof: We know, log, M = log, M x log,b
Putting M = a we get, log,a = log,a x log,b
or, 1 =log,a x log,b
- log,b = ! It _— (proved)
co log,b = Toga or log,a = Toe prove

Example 6. Find the values: 1) log,,100 2) logy g 3) log, 581
Solution:
1) log;u100 = log,10? = 2log;,10 [-.- log, (M" = rlog,,M|
=2x1=2[log,a=1]
1 1
2) log, (3) = log, (3) =logy37? = —2logy3 |. log, M" = rlog,M]
=-2x1=-2[ log,a=1]
3) log s81 = log, 53" = log 5{(V3)*}! = log 5(V3)*
=8log V3 =8x1=8[log,a=1]
Example 7. 1) What is the log of 5/5 to the base of 57 2) If the log of
400 is 4, then what is the base of log?
Solution:
