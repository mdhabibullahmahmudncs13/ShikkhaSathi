========================================

Proof: In AACR and AADR, CR = DR, AR = AR and the included ZARC =
included ZARD [right angle]
AACR = NADR.
LAC = AD
Now, In AABC, ZABC = Zz, BC =a [by construction]
and BA+ AC = BA+ AD = BD = s. Therefore, AABC is the required triangle.
Construction 2. The base of a triangle, an acute angle adjacent the base and
the difference between the other two sides are given. Construct the triangle.
Let the base a, a base adjacent acute angle Zz and the difference d of the other
two sides of a triangle be given. It is required to construct the triangle.
