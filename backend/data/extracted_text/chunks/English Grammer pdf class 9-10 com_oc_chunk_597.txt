How to Summarize

+ Read the original passage or text very carefully.

« Use a pencil to highlight or underline what you take to be the main
point/points of the original text, or make notes in the margins or on
another sheet of paper.

« If you're summarizing an entire essay, outline the writer's arguments.

+ These notes and outlines should be brief. Using this list of points, you
write down the summary, referring to the original text only when you
want to make sure of some point. This will help you to reproduce the
substance of the passage in your own words.
