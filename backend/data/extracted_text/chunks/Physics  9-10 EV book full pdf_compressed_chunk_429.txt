State of Matter and Pressure 147

Scientist Torricelli did this experiment of the pressure of air using mercury in the

year 1643. He did not try to make the mercury rise with a straw by mouth. He

filled a one ended tube with mercury and he put it in a mercury filled container

in an inverted way. After falling

continuously the mercury stopped at a height

of 76 cm. The vacancy which you try to !

create while sipping liquid, this vacancy was i

created in the upper portion of the glass tube. !

Air is exerting pressure on the mercury and |

that pressure being transmitted everywhere |

of the liquid, even down the tube. There is no |

leakage above the tube, so air cannot exert 76.cm

pressure through that side. Therefore to i
