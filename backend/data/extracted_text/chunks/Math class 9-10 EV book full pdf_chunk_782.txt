========================================

an angle 56° at the centre. Find the length of the arc and area of the circular
segment.
Solution: Let, radius of the circle r = 8 cm, length of arc is s and the angle
subtended by the circular segment is § = 56°.
rf 3.1416 x 8 x 56°
We know, s = TR Tr Fa 7.82 cm (approx.) and
Area of circular segment = bo x mr? = 56 x 3.1416 x 8 square cm = 31.28
one SCBment = 3600 “360 sduare em = St
square cm (approx.)
Example 20. If the difference between the radius and circumference of a circle
is 90 cm, find the radius of the circle.
Solution: Let the radius of the circle be 7.
.. Diameter of the circler is 2r and circumference = 277
" As per question, 277 — 2r = 90
IS
s or, 2r(m — 1) = 90
