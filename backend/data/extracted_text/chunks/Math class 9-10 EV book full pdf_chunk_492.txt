Horizontal Line, Vertical Line and Vertical Plane
A horizontal line is a straight line on the horizontal plane. A straight line parallel
to horizon is also called a horizontal line. A vertical line is a line perpendicular
to the horizontal plane. It is also called a normal line. A horizontal line and a
vertical line intersected at right angles on the plane define a plane. It is known as
vertical plane.

In the figure, a tree with height of AB is standing vertically
at a distance of C'B from a point C' on the horizontal plane.
Here, C'B is the horizontal line. BA is the vertical line and
