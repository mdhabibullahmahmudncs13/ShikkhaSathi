244 Physics
You know that when light moves from one medium to another, three different
events may happen . One is reflection, where some amount of light come back
to the first medium while entering the second medium and we have discussed
this in the previous chapter. Another one is refraction, when light passes from the
first medium to the second. We will discuss this in this chapter. Another one is
absorption, when some amount of light is absorbed, which we will not discuss
here.

rough a medium this velocity decreases. In a medium, the factor by
which the velocity of light reduces is the refraction of light of that medium .
For instance the velocity of light in water is 2.26x10% ms therefore the
refractive index of water is
