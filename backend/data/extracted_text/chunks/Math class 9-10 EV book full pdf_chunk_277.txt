31. The area of a land is 192 square metre. If the length of the land is decreased
by 4 metre and the breadth is increased by 4 metre, then the area remains
unchanged. Again a circle of 20 diametre was drawn in the center of the
land. A line drawn from the center of the circle perpendicular to one of the
chords is 2 cm less than the length of that chord.

1) Letting the length as x and the breadth as y express the information
by an equation.

2) Find the perimeter of the land.

3) Find the length of the chord of the circle.
