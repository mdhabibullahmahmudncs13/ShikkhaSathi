The infinitive without to
B Read the following sentences and notice the use of the infinitive with to
and without to.
My friend and | went to watch an English film on DVD at the British
Council Library yesterday. It was a very funny film and it made us laugh.
We tried hard not to laugh out loud and disturb other people but just
couldn’t stop. It was a story about a family where the parents let the
children do anything they wanted. We were laughing so much that
ultimately the assistant librarian came and made us leave. We'll
remember the incident for a long time to come.
Grammar point
We use the infinitive without to after modal verbs (will, can, could, may,
might, must, should, etc.)
e.g. We couldn't stop. We'll remember the incident.
