========================================

sub-sets of this set.
From this postulate we observe that each of plane and straight line is a set and
points are its elements. However, in geometrical description the notation of sets
is usually avoided. For example, a point included in a straight line or plane is
expressed by © the point lies on the straight line or plane’ or ‘the straight line
or plane passes through the point’. Similarly if a straight line is the subset of a
plane, it is expressed by such sentences as ‘the straight line lies on the plane, or
the plane passes through the straight line’.
It is accepted as properties of straight line and plane that,
Postulate 2: For two different points there exists one and only one straight line,
on which both the points lie.
