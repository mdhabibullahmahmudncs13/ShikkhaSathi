Multiplication and division of repeating decimal fractions
If repeating decimal fractions are first converted into common fractions and then
multiplication or division operations are performed, we can convert the result
into repeating decimal fractions. If finite decimal fractions and repeating
decimal fractions are multiplied or divided, then this rule should be followed.
However, in case of division if both divisor and dividend are repeating decimal
fractions, then converting them into similar repeating decimal fractions will ease
the operations.
Example 14. Multiply 4.3 with 5.7.
Solution: Bo4 39 13
43="2_"-_2_
9 9 3
- 57-5 52
pr=21"9_ 292
7 9 9
