========================================

expansion of the solid. Though a liquid has no definite shape, it has a definite
volume. So, we can explain or measure its expansion. It is very interesting in the
case of gas. Because neither does it
have a definite shape nor a definite
volume. A gas takes the whole
volume of its container. If the same
amount of a gas is kept in containers
of different volumes, the pressures
of the gases will be different. So, we
