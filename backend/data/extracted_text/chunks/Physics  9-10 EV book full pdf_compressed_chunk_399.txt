Question: Under water, pressure increases by 1 atm for a 33 ft (10 m) increase
of depth. The divers have gone a maximum depth of 1000 ft (330 m) , how much
pressure did they have to tolerate?
Answer: Per 10 m depth, pressure increases by 1 atm or 1 bar. Then, for 330 m
depth, 30m _
10 m/atm am
Divers had to tolerate 33 atm pressure.
Question: Calculate the pressure at a depth of 50 cm for kerosene (density 800
kg m?), water (density 1000 kg m*) and mercury (density 13600 kg m=).
Answer: For kerosene,
pressure, p= hpg

P =0.50m x 800 kgm x 9.8 Nkg! = 3,920 Nm?
For water,

P =0.50m x 1000 kgm? x 9.8 Nkg! = 4,900 N m?
For mercury,
