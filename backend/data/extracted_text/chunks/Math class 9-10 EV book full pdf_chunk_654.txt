========================================

of a geometric series a and the common ratio r are known, any term of the series
can be determined by putting n = 1,2,3,--- ete. successively in the equation of
the nth term.
Example 7. What is the 10th term of the series 2 +4 + 8+ 16+ ---?
s . . 4
Solution: The first term of the series a = 2, common ratio r = 5= 2
.. The given series is a geometric series.
We know, the nth term of a geometric series = ar"!
10th term of the series= 2 x 210-1 = 2 x 29 = 1024
Example 8. What is the general term of the series 128 4+ 64 + 32 +4 --- 7
. . . 64 1
Solution: The first term of the series a = 128, common ratio r = sa
It is a geometric series. N

We know, general term of geometric series = ar! S
