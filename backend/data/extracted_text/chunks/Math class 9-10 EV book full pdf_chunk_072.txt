N:10 <x < 11}, {z € N : x prime and 23 < x < 29} etc.

represented by a geometric figure like rectangles, cicrles and triangles in a plane.
These pictures have been named after John Venn.
Subset
A = {a,b} is a set. Sets {a,b}, {a}, {b} can be formed from the elements of this
set. Again, we can form a subset @ with no elements at all. These sets {a,b}, {a},
{b}, @ are subsets of set A. All the sets that can be formed from a set are called
