If we have done the experiment properly, we will find that similar charges

repulse each other and opposite charges attract each other.

10.3 Electrical Induction

At the beginning of this chapter it was said that if you comb your hair and then

hold the comb near some small pieces of paper, you will notice that the pieces of

paper jump towards the comb. The comb is attracting the pieces of paper. We

know that negative charge has been gathered in the comb and due to this reason

the comb is attracting the pieces of paper. But there is a slight complexity. We

know opposite charges attract each other, so to attract the pieces of paper
