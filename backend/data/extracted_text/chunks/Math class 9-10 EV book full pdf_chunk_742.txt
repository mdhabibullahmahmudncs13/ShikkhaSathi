Example 4. The area of an equilateral triangle increases by 3v/3 sq. metre
when the length of each side increases by 1 metre. Find the length of the side of
the triangle.
Solution:
Let, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is
3
a metre. Its area = SER sq. metre.
The area of the triangle when the length of each side
3
increases by 1 metre = v3, +1)? sq. metre.
