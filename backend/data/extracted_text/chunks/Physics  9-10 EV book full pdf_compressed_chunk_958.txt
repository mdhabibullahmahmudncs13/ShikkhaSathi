========================================

by a neighboring electron. Then an empty place will be created in the
neighboring atom, this place again can be occupied by an electron of its
neighboring atom, then an empty place also will be created there. Another way
to see it is that an empty place with the lack of an electron is moving from atom
to atom. It seems that it is one type of particle and its charge is positive. It is
called a hole. That is, we can say that keeping a boron atom as a negative ion,
this hole can move through the whole silicon crystal. That is, this semiconductor
almost acts as a conductor and positively charged holes conduct electricity
through it! When a semiconductor becomes a conductor by adding atoms having
three electrons in their outer most shells, it is called a p-type semiconductor.
