Relative error = —————

Measured value

So in our previous example:

Relative error: 0.5 mm/ 7 mm = 0.071

In percentage this is: 0.071 x 100 =7.1 %
Question: Suppose you have got 10 cm by measuring the length of a square
shaped book. Suppose the relative error in the measurement is 10%. What is the
relative error in its area?
Answer:
Measured area of the object =10 cm*10 cm=100 cm?
Since the relative error of the object is 10%, hence if its length is measured, the
minimum length will be 9 cm and maximum length will be 11 cm.
~ The minimum area = 9 cm x 9 cm = 81 cm?
and the maximum area = 11cm x 11cm = 121 cm?
Therefore the absolute error:

1100 cm? — 81 cm?| = 19 cm?m?
or, [121 cm? —100 cm?| =21 ¢
