Geometric proof
In geometry, special importance is attached to some propositions which are
taken as theorems and used successively in establishing other propositions. In
geometric proof different statements are explained with the help of figures.
But the proof must be logical.
In describing geometric propositions general or particular enunciation is used.
The general enunciation is the description independent of the figure and the
particular enunciation is the description based on the figure. If the general
enunciation of a proposition is given, subject matter of the proposition is
specified through particular enunciation. For this, necessary figure is to be
drawn.
