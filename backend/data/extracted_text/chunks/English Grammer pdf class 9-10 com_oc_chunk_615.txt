========================================

do few things together as a group. Parents often go out together as a couple,
apart from their children. Each child has his or her friends. Some families have
more than one television set so that all the members do not even watch
television together. Instead of families making their own fun together,
individual members tend to go to recreational facilities for entertainment.
