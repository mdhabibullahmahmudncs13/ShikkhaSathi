Chapter 9. Trigonometric Ratio 203
Trigonometric ratios of complementary angles
We know, if the sum of two acute angles is 90°, one of them is called
complementary angle to the other. For example, 30° and 60° and 15° and 75° are
complementary angles to each other.
In general, the angles 6 and (90° — #) are complementary angles to each other.
Let ZXOY = 6 and P is the point on the side OY y
of the angle. We draw PM 1 OX.
Since the sum of the three angles of a triangle is two L
right angles, therefore, in the right angled triangle d
POM, ZPMO = 90°
and ZOPM + ZPOM = one right angle = 90°
ZOPM = 90° — ZPOM = 90° — 0 £6) a
