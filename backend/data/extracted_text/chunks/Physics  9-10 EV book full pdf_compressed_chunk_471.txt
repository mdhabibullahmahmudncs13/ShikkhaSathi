========================================

from the body of higher temperature to

the body of lower temperature until the

temperature of the two bodies becomes

equal.

But we have not yet defined the

quantity called “temperature” yet. But

it is used so much in daily life that

nobody faces problems in YO

understanding ~~ what temperature SIs oo=

means. According to physics we can = EE====saa

say that it is the measure of average ye TIZTZIIIEE

kinetic energy of the molecules of ; ] ;

matter. From our experience we can Figure 6.01: Temperature is as like

say that temperature is the thermal pe height orate and heatis as

state which indicates whether an object ike the volume of liquid

absorbs or rejects heat when it comes in contact with another object. To
