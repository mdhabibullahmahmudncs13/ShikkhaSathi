Theorem 10 (ASA Theorem):

If in one triangle, two angles and the included side are respectively equal to

two angles and the included side of another triangle, then the two triangles are

congruent. i -

Special Nomination: Suppose

in AABC and ADEF,

/B=/E, /C=/F, and the

included side BC=EF. 8 CE ¥

We need to prove that AABC = ADEF.

Proof:

1. Place AABC on ADEF in such a way that point B coincides with point

E, and side BC coincides with side EF, with point A falling on the same side of

EF as point D. Since BC=EF, point C will necessarily coincide with point F.

[Equality of sides]

2. Since /B=/E, side BA will coincide with side ED, and since Z/C=/F,

side CA will coincide with side FD. [Equality of angles]
