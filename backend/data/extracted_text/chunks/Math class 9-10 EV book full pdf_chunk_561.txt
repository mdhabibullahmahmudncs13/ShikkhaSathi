========================================

Now, we fill in the following chart from the equation 2x-+y=12:
Value of y | Value of L.H.S (22 + y)
SATE
(ESTE)
Gro-1
ETE
(SS I ER I
The equation has infinite number of solutions. Among those, four solutions are:
(=2.16), (0,12), (3,6), (5,2).
Again, we fill in the following chart from another equation r —y = 3:
Value of y | Value of L.H.S (z —y)
25-3
EC BT NF
EE FF = SI
[ES EE TR
The equation has infinite number of solutions. Among those, four solutions are:
(=2.-5), (0,3), (3,0), (5,2).
If the two equations discussed above are considered together a system, both the
equations will be satisfied simultaneously only by (5,2). Both the equations will
not be satisfied simultaneously by any other values.
“ Therefore, the solution of the system of equations 2x +y = 12 and  —y = 3 is
