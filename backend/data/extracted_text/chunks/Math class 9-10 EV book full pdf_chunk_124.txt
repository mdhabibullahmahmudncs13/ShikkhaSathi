========================================

x difference of two expressions.
Formula 4. (z+ a)(z +b) = 2% + (a + b)x + ab
Therefore, (r+ a)(z +b) = 22+ (algebraic sum of a and b) = + (the product of a
and b)
Extension of formula for square: There are three terms in the expression
a+ b+ c. It can be considered the sum of two terms (a + b) and c. Therefore, by
applying Formula 1, the square of the expression is,
(a+b+c)*={(a+b) +c}? = (a+b)? +2a+bc+c?
=a? + 2ab +b? + 2ac + 2bc + * = a® + b* + c+ 2ab + 2bc + 2ac
Formula 5. (a +b+c)? =a® +b +c? + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac
Nn Corollary 7. a? +b? +c = (a+b +c)? — 2(ab + be + ac)
a
5 Corollary 8.  2(ab + be + ac) = (a+b +c)? — (a> +b? + 2)
