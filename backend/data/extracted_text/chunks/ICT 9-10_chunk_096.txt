Information Security and Cyber Risk
Information has become one of the most valuable resources today. There are two
main fypes of access: open information and confidential information. Open data
is freely accessible to everyone and can be shared without restrictions. Examples
include news, articles, and press releases from organizations or institutions. It is
made [or public use and does not require any complex security. On the other
hand, confidential information is restricted to authorized individuals or organiza-
tions and is protected by legal obligations. For example, commercial contracts,
., national identity cards, passwords, etc. Disclosure of confidential information
§ without permission may result in legal complications or financial compensation.
