========================================

A glass tube contains mercury at the bottom. If heat
is applied, the volume of mercury is increased and it «— Fine curve
goes up through the capillary tube. To what extent it «— Mercury
reaches is the measurement of the temperature.
While measuring the fever by a thermometer, it is to ~~ Figure 6.05 : Fine curve
be taken out from the mouth or the armpit, a very fine 1s made in tube, so that
curve is made at the bottom of the narrow tube. Due ~~ Mercury can not fall in
to expansion, once the mercury level rises up, it fever measuring
cannot come down even after decreasing the thermometer
temperature. Mercury is brought down by shaking.
Real and Apparent Expansion
It has been said earlier that a liquid is always heated in a container. If heat is
