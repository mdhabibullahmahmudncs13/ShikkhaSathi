Effect of Heat on Matter 169
If the length of an object is L, at temperature 7, and the length is increased to L,
after increasing the temperature to 7, then the co-efficient of linear expansion
ois
a= (L, — L/L,
TO nL-T
s0,
Ly = Ly + oly (T, — Ty)
Similarly if the area of an object is 4, at temperature 7, and increasing the
temperature 7, if the area is increased to 4,, then the co-efficient of area
expansion f is
B= (4; —A)/A
TO nL-T
so,
Ay = Ay + BA(T, — TT)
Again similarly if the volume is V at temperature 7, and if the volume is
increased to V,, then the co-efficient of expansion of volume is ¥
RAYA
TTT
so,
Vo =Vy +yVi(T, = Ty)
You see that the unit of three quantities a, and ¥ is K™'.
Dimension[a] = [#8] = [y] =[1-1]
