t = time taken.
Q(t) = amount of water in the tank in time ¢
SQ) =QoEqgt
47 sign at the time of flowing of water in and '—’ sign, at the time of flowing of
water out are to be used.
Related to percentage
Suppose, b = total quantity
r = rate of percentage = So s%
100
p = part of percentage s% of =b
cop=br
Related to profit and loss
Suppose, C' = cost price
7 = rate of profit or loss
selling price S = C(1 +7)
in case of profit, § = C(1 +7)
in case of loss, S = C'(1—7r)
Related to investment and profit
Suppose, I = profit after time n
n = specific time
P = principal
7 = profit of unit principal at unit time
A = principal with profit after time n
In the case of simple profit,
I= Pnr
A=P+1=P+Pnr=P(l+nr)
In the case of compound profit, N
A=P(L+r) g
