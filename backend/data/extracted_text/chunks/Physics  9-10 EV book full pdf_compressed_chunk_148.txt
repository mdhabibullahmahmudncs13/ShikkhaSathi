Motion 47
Acceleration,
v—u 0-268m/s ,
a= ——=—g5ps = —0.089 m/s
Thus the acceleration of the car —0.089 m/s? or deceleration 0.089 m/s”
Question: The velocity of a bullet is 1.5 km/s. It has penetrated 10 cm of a wall.
What is the deceleration of the bullet?
Answer: The only way to solve this problem is to use the formula
v? =u? —2as
Final velocity, v = 0
0 = (1.5% 1000)? — 2 (305)
chee “(Too
1.5 x 1000
a= (LS 10007 = 11,250,000 m/s?
Deceleration: 11,250,000 m/s? (or acceleration: —11,250,000 m/s?)
