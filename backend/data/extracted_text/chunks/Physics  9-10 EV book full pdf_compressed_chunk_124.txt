2.4 Distance and Displacement

We are quite familiar with the word ‘distance’ but we do not use the word
‘displacement’ in our daily life. We want to understand the relation between the
two words- distance and displacement with the help of an example. A curved
path is shown in figure 2.04. The distance travelled with respect to the point A
is denoted by the number 1, 2, 3 in kilometer.

Let us consider you are at point A (i.e.

your position is point A). Now you have = rE

reached point B by 4 km way by yd a \
riding a bicycle along the curved path. | J ™N

We can say the distance between point A A\Y/& oo ))

and point B is 4 km. Distance is a scalar ~~ / Js
quantity, so to express the distance Sh J
between the points A and B we need not fz
