Obtuse triangle G
A triangle having an angle obtuse is an obtuse angled - 7
triangle. In the figure, the ZG'K H is an obtuse angle; " %
the two other angles ZGHK and ZHGK are acute.
AGHK is an obtuse angled triangle.
Interior and Exterior Angles
If a side of a triangle is produced, a new angle is formed. This angle is known
as exterior angle. Except the angle adjacent to the exterior angle, the two others
angles of the triangle are known as opposite interior angles.
In the adjacent figure, the side BC of AABC is A
extended to D. The angle ZAC'D is an exterior angle
of the triangle. ZABC', ZBAC and ZACB are three
interior angles. ZACB is the adjacent interior angle 5 = D
of the exterior angle ZACD. Each of ZABC and
