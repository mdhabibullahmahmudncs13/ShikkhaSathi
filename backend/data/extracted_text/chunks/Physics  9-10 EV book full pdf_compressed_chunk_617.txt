Reflection of Light 223
Question: Two mirrors are placed mutually at 60°
angle (Figure 8.13). If light is incident on the first
mirror at an angle of 60°, what will be the direction H 8
of light? 60° 2
Answer: From geometry it can be said that he eg
the ray will incident on the point B
perpendicularly, and reflect in the opposite Figure 8.13: Two mirrors kept at
direction. an angle of 60°, light is incident at
point A on a mirror at an angle 60°.

In a dark room, make a very small hole in the middle of a piece of
cardboard and place a candle before it. On the opposite side of the board,
hold a white paper, as shown in Figure 8.14. If you do not allow any other
