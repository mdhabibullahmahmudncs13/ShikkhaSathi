Effect of Heat on Matter 181
Answer: Let us assume the temperature of ice is 0 °C.
Mass of ice my; = 100 gm = 0.1 kg
Mass of liter water mp = 1kg
Specific heat of water s = 4.2 x 103 Jkg'K!
The water of 1kg has to supply the heat that is required to melt the piece of ice
and to raise the temperature of the ice melted water to its final temperature. Let
us consider the final temperature of water is 7, then the amount of heat absorbed
by the ice is:
Heat required to melt: m L
The heat required to increase the temperature from 0 °C to T after melting: m s(T-0)
The mass of water m, supplies these amounts of heat, so its temperature will
decrease.
That is,
The heat supplied: m,s(30° C—T)
These two types of heat must be equal. Hence:
myL + mysT =mys(30°C —T)
