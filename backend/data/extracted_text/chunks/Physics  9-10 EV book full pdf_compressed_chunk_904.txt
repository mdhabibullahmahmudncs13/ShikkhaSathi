========================================

voltage source is connected. Since the wire is connected by winding the iron
core, so when current will flow the core will be magnetized and the magnetic
lines of force will pass through the rectangular iron core.
Since we have connected AC voltage source, the magnetic strength inside the
core will increase or decrease and will change its direction, i.e. the magnetic field
will change continuously. On the other side of the iron core, there is wire winding
also (definitely covered with insulator). The magnetic field will change
continuously in that coil through the iron core, and this change will produce an
electromotive force (emf) in the coil of the right side. If we wish, we can see it
in a voltmeter. The transfer of electricity from one coil to another coil in this
