For a point charge q, using Coulomb's law, it can be shown that

Electric potential is a scalar quantity. The unit of measurement in the SI System
of Units is the Volt (V).
If the work done in bringing 1 C positive charge to a point from an infinite
distance is 1J, then the potential at that point is 1V :
