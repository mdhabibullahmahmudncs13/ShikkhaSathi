familiar example of it is water; it can exist in three states, e.g. solid, liquid and
gas. Whether it is ice, water or vapor depends on how the molecules are within
it.
When a substance remains in the gaseous state, then its molecules are free, the
distance between one another is very large. When the substance is in a liquid
state, then though the molecule remains comparatively closer but they can move
with respect to one another. In solid state, molecules remain the closest, but can
not move with respect to the other.
