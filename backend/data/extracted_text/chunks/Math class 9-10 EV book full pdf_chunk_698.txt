Symmetry is an important geometrical concept, commonly exhibited in nature
and is used almost in every field of our activity. Artists, designers, architects,
carpenters always make use of the idea of symmetry. Tree-leaves, flowers,
beehives, houses, tables, chairs -everywhere we find symmetrical designs. A
figure has line symmetry, if there is a line about which the figure may be folded
so that the two parts of the figure will coincide.
