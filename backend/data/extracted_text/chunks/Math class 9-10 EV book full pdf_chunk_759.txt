========================================

or, (x — 8) metre.

Area of the square field excluding the road is = (x — 8)?

sq. metre

Area of the road = 2? — (z — 8)? sq. metre

We know, 1 hector = 10000 sq. metre

According to the question, 2? — (x — 8) = 10000

or, 22 — 2? + 162 — 64 = 10000

or, 16x = 10064

coa= 629

Area of the square field excluding the road

= (629 — 8)? sq. metre = 385641 sq. metre = 38.56 hector (approx.)

The required area = 38.56 hector (approx.).

Example 11. The area of a parallelogram is 120 sq. cm and length of one of
its diagonal is 24 cm. Determine the length of the perpendicular drawn on that
diagonal from the opposite vertex.
