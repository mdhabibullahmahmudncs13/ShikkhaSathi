7.1 Simple Harmonic Motion
By attaching a mass at the lower end of a spring if we release it after pulling, it
will move up-down (In chapter 3 and 4 we have explained this motion). We have
seen that due to friction or other means, energy is lost; and it stops after a while.
Otherwise, it would move up-down for an infinite time. We have also seen that
in simple harmonic motion, the energy of the mass attached to the spring
exchanges between kinetic energy and potential energy. We can assume that the
spring follows Hooke's law. Let’s recall the law: if the spring constant is k and
the position of the end of the spring is at a distance x from its equilibrium
position, then the restoring force Fof the spring is given by:
F = —kx
