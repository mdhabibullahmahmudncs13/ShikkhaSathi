In the figure, if depression angle ZCAE = 60°, Tr E

elevation angle ZADB = 30°, AC = 36 metre, “

AB L DC and D, C, B lic on the same straight "

line, find the lengths of the sides AD, AB and C'D.p 7) 4
Example 5. The angle of elevation at a point of the roof of a building is 60° in
any point on the ground. Moving back 42 metre from the angle of elevation of the
point of the place of the building becomes 45°. Find the height of the building.
Solution: Let, the height of the building is AB = h metres. The angle of elevation
at the top ZACB = 60°. The angle of elevation becomes ZADB = 45° moving
back from C' by CD = 42 metre.
Let, BC' = x metre. n
BD = BC + CD = (x + 42) metre.
From AABC we get,
tan “aon = ed or, tan 60° = 3 hm
