.. at present, Father's age is 32 years and son's age is 11 years.
Example 14. Twice the breadth of a rectangular garden is 10 metre more
than its length and perimeter of the garden is 100 metre. There is a path of width
2 metre around the outside boundary of the garden. To make the path by bricks,
it costs TI. 110 per square metre.
1) Assuming the length of the garden to be x metre and its breadth to be y
metre, form system of simultaneous equations.
2) Find the length and breadth of the garden.
3) What will be the total cost to make the path by bricks?
Solution:
1) Length of the rectangular garden is z metre and
breadth is y metre.
