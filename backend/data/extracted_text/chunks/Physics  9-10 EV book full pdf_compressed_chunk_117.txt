========================================

the same direction in the same manner in a definite interval of time, then this motion

is called a periodic motion. The time interval over which this repetition occurs
& is called the period of the motion. In a periodic motion, a moving particle
5 traverses each point in its path with the same speed after each period.

36 Physics
The vibrational motion of our heart is periodic, since it vibrates in the same
direction in the same manner after a definite interval of time. The periodic
motion may be circular (motion of the blades of a fan), hyperbolic ( orbit of
Haley's Comet around the sun) or linear ( oscillatory motion of an object hanging
from a spring).
