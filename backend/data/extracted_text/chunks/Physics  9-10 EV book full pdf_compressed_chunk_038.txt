========================================

Due to the invention of electronics and modern technology it is possible to make
powerful particle accelerators. Accelerating the particle with high energy, new
particles are being discovered. It is possible to arrange these particles
systematically using the Theoretical Standard Model. It is possible to explain the
structure of all the particles using a few elementary particles (and their
antiparticles) though apparently we think there are an infinite numbers of new
particles. It is not possible to explain the mass of the particles using the Standard
Model, so to explain the mass, the existence of a new particle called the Higgs
Boson was proposed. The identification of the Higgs Boson particle in the
laboratory in 2013 is treated as a great success of theoretical physics.
