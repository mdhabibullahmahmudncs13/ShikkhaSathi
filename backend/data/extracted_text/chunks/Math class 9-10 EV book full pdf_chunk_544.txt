Chapter 11. Algebraic Ratio and Proportion 237
Example 15. The area of a rectangular land is 12 hectors and length of its
diagonal is 500 metres. The ratio of length and breadth of this land to that of
other land are 3 : 4 and 2 : 3, respectively.
1) What is the area of the given land in square metre?
2) What is the area of the other land?
3) What is the breadth of the given land?
Solution:
1) We know, 1 hector = 10,000 square metres.
12 hectors = 12 x 10,000 = 120000 square metres
2) Given that, the ratio of length and breadth of the given land to that of other
land are 3 : 4 and 2 : 3, respectively.
Let length of the given land be 3z metres and breadth be 2y metres.
Therefore, the length of the other land is 4 metres and breadth is 3y metres.
