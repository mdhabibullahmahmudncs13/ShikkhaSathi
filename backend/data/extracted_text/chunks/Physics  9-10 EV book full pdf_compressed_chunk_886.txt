Therefore, the magnetic field produced by
the current and the magnetic field

@ ‘=3%: AY] produced by the iron piece itself combine
- ep & itv to produce a strong magnetic field (Figure
- 12.07). The interesting point is, as the
current is stopped, the small magnets
a) A I) A) present within the iron piece become
— randomly oriented again, and the entire
J — / magnetic field will disappear.
i / / A magnet prepared by this process
A AAA is called an electromagnet. Uses of
fics will le electromagnets are endless, Such as in the
i , a) sound we hear in speakers and earphones
(Figure 12.08).
