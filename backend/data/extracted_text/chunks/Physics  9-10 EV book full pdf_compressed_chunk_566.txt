Question: Figure 7.08 shows a wave at a particular time in different position and
for a particular positions in different times. Determine its amplitude,
wavelength, time period, frequency, and velocity.
Answer: From the first figure we see that, the wave has,
Amplitude, a = 0.1m
Wavelength, 2 =1m
From the second figure we see that, the wave has,
Amplitude, a = 0.1 m (we know it from the first figure also)
Time period, T = 0.2 s
We can calculate frequency f from the time period,
f 1 1 5H

position (m) time (s)
Figure 7.08: A wave with respect to position and time simultaneously
Therefore, using the information of the two figures, we can say
v=Af =1mx5Hz=5 m/s
