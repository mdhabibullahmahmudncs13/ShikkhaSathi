and -2q charge.

Question: A charge of 3 C is experiencing a force of 10 N. What is the electric
field?
Answer: We know F=¢E
So, F

E=—

q
Here, F=10N
q=3C
Therefore, pe F10N —-

Question: If there are two charges q and -2q close to each other, what will be
their lines of force?
Answer: This is shown in Figure 10.13.
