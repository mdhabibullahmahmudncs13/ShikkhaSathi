ANB ANBNC
Example 9. IfP={reN:2<2<6}andQ={r€N:xiscvenand
x < 8}, determine PN Q. BS


--- Page 34 ---
Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 29
Solution: Given,
P={zeN:2<z<6}={34,506}
Q={reN:xisevenand x <8} ={2,4,6,8}
SL PNQ=1{3.4506}n{24,6,8} = {4.6}
The set to be determined is {4,6} PNQ
Disjoint Set
If there is no element common to any two sets, then these two sets are called
disjoint sets. Let A and B be two sets. If ANB = @ then A and B are said
to be mutually disjoint sets.
Work: If U = {1,3,5,9,7,11}, E = {1,59} and F = {3,7,11}, then
determine EU F¢ and EN F*.
