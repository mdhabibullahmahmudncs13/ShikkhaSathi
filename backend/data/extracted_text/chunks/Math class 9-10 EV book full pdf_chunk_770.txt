========================================

Length of diagonal of rectangle ABCD = +/50% + 14? cm = 51.92 cm
(approx.)
2) Area of rectangle ABC'D = 50 x 14 square cm = 700 square cm
1 1
Area of triangle ADE = 34D - AE -sin/DAE = 3 x 50 x 50 x sin73.74°
square cm = 24 x 50 x 0.960001 square cm = 1200 square cm (approx.)
Total area = (700 4 1200) square cm = 1900 square cm
3) Let, in AADE, AD = AE =50 cm =a, DE=b
b v
.. Area of the isosceles triangle ADE = Tv 4a — 1?
b 5
As per the question, Via — b> = 1200
by/4(50)% — b* = 4800 N
3
or, b2(10000 — b?) = 23040000 [by squaring] S
