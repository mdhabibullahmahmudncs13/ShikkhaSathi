2.8 Laws of Falling Bodies
We have already mentioned that an amazing example of uniform acceleration is
acceleration due to gravity g. Due to its effect an object falls downward when it
is released from above the earth surface. Observing these types of falling bodies
Galileo invented three laws. The laws can be used in case of bodies falling
freely. The laws are as follows:

First law: All bodies falling from rest and from the same height without any

resistance traverse equal distance in the same time.

Second law: The velocity (v), acquired by a freely falling body from rest in

a given time (7) is directly proportional to that time. i.e.v oc t

Third law: The distance (/) traversed by a freely falling body from rest in a
