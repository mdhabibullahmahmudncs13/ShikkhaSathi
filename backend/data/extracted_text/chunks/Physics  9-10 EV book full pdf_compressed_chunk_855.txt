11.5 Safe Use of Electricity

We cannot think of a moment without electricity. Electricity brings light to our
house, keeps us cool in the summer by using fans. We watch television and use
computers using electricity. Electricity runs fridges that preserve food. We use
it to iron clothes. When the charge of mobiles gets low, we use electricity to
charge the battery. Rich people use AC in their houses, washing machines to
wash clothes, and electric heaters to cook. They prepare warm meals by heating
using microwave ovens.
