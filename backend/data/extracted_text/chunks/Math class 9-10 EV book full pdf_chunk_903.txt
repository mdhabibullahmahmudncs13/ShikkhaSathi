Inclusion to Chapter 6
Quadrilateral
In previous classes, we have discussed triangles and quadrilaterals. In
constructing a particular triangle, we have seen that three measures are required.
So, naturally the question arises whether four measures are enough to draw a
quadrilateral. In this chapter, we shall discuss this matter. Besides, different types
of quadrilaterals, such as parallelograms, rectangles, squares and rhombuses
have various properties. The properties of these quadrilaterals and their
constructions have also been discussed in this chapter.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to -
» Verify and logically prove the properties of quadrilateral.
» Construct quadrilaterals from given data.
