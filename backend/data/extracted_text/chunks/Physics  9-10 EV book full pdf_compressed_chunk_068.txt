========================================

4. No punctuation mark or period is used with the symbols, as they are
mathematical expressions but not the abbreviated form of anything.

5. The symbol of unit is written in straight font, for example, m for metre, s
for second etc. But the symbol of quantities are written in italic or curved
font, for example, m for mass, v for velocity etc.

6. The symbols of units are written in small letters, for example, cm, s, mol etc.
But capital letters are used for those units which are taken from the name of scientists
(N for Newton). If there are many letters in the unit then the first letter will be
capital only (the unit from the name of Pascal is Pa).

7. The prefix (k, G, M) of unit will be attached with the unit (m, W, Hz) with
no space. For example, km, GW, MHz.
