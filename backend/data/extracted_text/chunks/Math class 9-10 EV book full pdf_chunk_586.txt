solution: (x,y) = (12,6)
Verification of the correctness of the solution:
Putting the values of zy in given equations,
. ry 12 6
In first t LHS=-+=—+4-= 2=8=RH
1 first equation, S 2t3 2 t3 6+ 8§=R.HS

In second equation, L.H.S = = —3y = bx —3x6=15-18=-3=RHS.
.". the solution is correct.
Example 7. Solve by the method of cross-multiplication: ax —by = ab = br—ay
Solution: Given equations are:
ar — by = ab ar —by —ab=0
br — ay = ab on br — ay — ab =0 By the
By the method of cross-multiplication, we get,
x _ y
(=b) x (—ab) — (—a)(—ab) ~ (—ab) x b— (—ab) x a
