========================================

In the morning our relations started coming, the neighbours also came.
Preparations were being made for his burial. As it was the first death of
one of my closest persons in my life, | felt emotionally paralyzed. It was
a feeling that can only be felt, cannot be described in language. | could
not understand at that point of time how human beings survive after
the death of their near ones. My existence seemed meaningless
without him.

When people took him for burial and put him in the grave, it seemed my
joys were all buried with him. This feeling continued for a long time; |
did not feel like going to school, even if | was sent to school, life seemed
joyless to me.

Till today, the agony of losing him pains me whenever | think of that day.
