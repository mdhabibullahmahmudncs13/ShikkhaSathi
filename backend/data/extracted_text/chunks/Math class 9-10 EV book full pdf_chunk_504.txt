Here, CD = AC = AB — BC = (h — x) metre hm
From ABCD we get, /|

Again, sin ZBCD 5b in 30° BD ! 10

or, h— x =20 or, h = 20 +x or, h = 20 + 10v/3 [putting the value of x]
.h = 37.321 (approx.)
.-. Height of the pole is 37.32 metre (approx.).
‘Work: A balloon is flying above any point between two kilometre posts. At
the point of the balloon the angle of depression of the two posts are 30° and "-
60° respectively. Find the height of the balloon. g
