Chapter 1. Real Numbers 13
Example 10. Add 3.89, 2.178 and 5.89798.
Solution: We have 2 digits in nonrepeating part, and repeating parts have
respectively 2, 2 and 3 for which LCM is 6. At first all these three reepating
decimal fractions have been converted into similar repeating decimal fractions.
3.89 = 3.89898989
2178 =2.17878787
5.80798 = 5.89798793
1197576574 [8 +8+7+2 = 25, here 2 is 2 in hand
+2 here 2 of 25 has been added]
11.97576576
The desired result is 11.97576576 or, 11.97576
Remarks: In the result 576576 is repeating part. But if we assume 576 in the
repeating part, then there will be no change of value.
Note: In order to clarify addition at the rightmost digit we have solved the
addition in a different way:
3.89 = 3.89898989[89
2.178 = 2.17878787|87
