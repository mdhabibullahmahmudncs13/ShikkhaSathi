State of Matter and Pressure 149
It is seen that the deformation has no
unit, it is only a number. a
Stress: The force per unit area that |
develops within a substance due to L.
deformation is called stress. 1 L
If a force is applied on a body of cross T
sectional area 4 and as a result
deformation occurs, then if this
deformation develops a resistive force
F, then stress is: yo
Li lv
A
You see it is similar to pressure and its Figure 5.11: Deformation occurs in
unit is Pa or Pascal. a bar if stress is created by applied
force.

Hooke’s law: If we have understood stress and strain, it is easy to

understand Hooke’s law. According to this law, ‘within elastic limits stress

is directly proportional to strain’.
