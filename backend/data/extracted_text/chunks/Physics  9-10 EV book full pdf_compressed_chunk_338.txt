========================================

exactly, it attains the maximum velocity. So it does not stop there rather moves
away in the opposite direction and rises up until its velocity becomes zero.
Therefore, it again develops a potential energy. When it reaches the maximum
height it stops there, owing to its potential energy again it starts moving towards
the stationary state. In this way, the stone oscillates and transformation from
potential energy to kinetic energy and kinetic energy to potential energy
continues. This process would continue for an infinite time if there was no
friction and other causes of energy loss.
Therefore,the transformation of energy is a very natural process. Transformation
of energy takes place not only between potential energy and kinetic energy. But
