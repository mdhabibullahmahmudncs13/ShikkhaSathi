Solution: A°=U\A={1.2,3.4,5.6,7}\ {2,4,6,7} = {1,3,5}

and B* =U \ B={1,2,3,4,5,6,7} \ {1,3,5} = {2,4,6,7}

The required sets are A° = {1,3,5} and B® = {2,4,6,7}

Union of Sets

The set consisting of elements of two or more sets is said to be union of sets.
Let, A and B be two sets. The union of sets A and B is denoted by AU B and
read as A union B. In set building method AUB = {x : 2 € Aor x € B}
Example 8. If C' = {3,4,5} and D = {4,6,8}, determine C'U I)

C D
Solution: Given C'= {3,4,5}
and D = {4,6,8}
CUD ={3,4,5}U{4,6,8} = {3,4,5,6,8}
The set to be determined is: {3,4,5,6,8}
