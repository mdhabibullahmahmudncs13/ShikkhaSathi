Angle of Elevation and Angle of Depression
Observe the figure, AB is a straight line parallel to r
the horizon. The points A, O, B, P and @Q lie on the ,
gle of

same vertical plane. The point P on the straight line clovation
AB makes angle ZPOB with the line AB. Here at A P) el
O, the angle of elevation of P is ZPOB. ge
So, the angle at any point above the plane with the
straight line parallel to horizon is called the angle of <
elevation. ~~
The points @, licat lower side of the straight line dim
AB parallel to horizon. Here, the angle of depression <<
at O of Q is ZQOB. So, the angle at any point | |
below the straight line parallel to the plane is called ya M
the angle of depression. C—
