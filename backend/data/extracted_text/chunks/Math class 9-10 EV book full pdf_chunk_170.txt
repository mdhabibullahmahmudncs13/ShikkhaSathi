Therefore, they together can finish the work in 6 days.
Example 36. A boatman can row z= km in time ¢; hour against the current.
To cover that distance along the current he takes t, hour. How much is the speed
of the boat and the current?
Solution: Let the speed of the boat in still water be « km per hour and that of
the current be v km per hour.
Then, along the current, the effective speed of boat is (u + v) km per hour and
against the current, the effective speed of boat is (u — v) km per hour.
We know, speed = distance traversed
time
