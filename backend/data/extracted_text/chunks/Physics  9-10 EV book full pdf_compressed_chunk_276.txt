========================================

3. Using wheel friction can be reduced. If wheel is used we can do work by very
small rolling friction instead of large sliding friction. It is possible to reduce
friction to a great extent by using ball bearings in the rotating wheel, using the
rolling friction of the small steel balls instead of the direct friction.
4. The design of the fast moving vehicles like car, plane is done in such a way
that the wind can flow over the streamline surface without creating any friction.
5. The surfaces where friction occurs touch one another in a very small region,
then friction can be reduced.
6. We have seen that if force is applied on the two frictional surfaces, friction is
increased. Therefore if vertically applied force is reduced, friction can be
reduced.
