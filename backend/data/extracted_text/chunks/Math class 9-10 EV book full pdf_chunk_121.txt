numbers including zero are used. Algebra is the generalization of
arithmetic.
The numbers used in algebraic expressions are constants, their values are
fixed. The letter symbols used in algebraic expressions are variables, their values
are not fixed, they can be of any value.
Algebraic Formulae
Any general rule or resolution expressed by algebraic symbols is called Algebraic
Formula. In class VII and VIII, algebraic formulae and related corollaries have
been discussed. In this chapter, some applications are presented on the basis of
that discussion.
Formula 1. (a+b)? = a® + 2ab + b*
Formula 2. (a —b)? =a — 2ab + b*
Remarks: It is seen from Formula 1 and Formula 2 that, adding 2ab or —2ab to
