========================================

Two Variables
[Prior knowledge of this chapter are attached to the Appendix at the end of this
book. At first the Appendix should be read / discussed. ]
For solving the mathematical problems, the most important topic of Algebra is
equation. In classes VI and VII, we have got the idea of simple equation and
have known how to solve the simple equation inone variable. In class VIII,
we have solved the simple simultaneous equations by the methods of substitution
and elimination and by graphs. We have also learnt how to form and solve simple
simultaneous equations related to real life problems. In this chapter, the idea of
simple simultaneous equations have been expanded and new methods of solution
have been discussed. Besides, in this chapter, solution by graphs and formation
