The required radius of the circle is 21.01 cm (approx.)
Example 21. The diameter of a circular field is 124 metre There is a path with
6 metre. width around the field. Find the arca of the path.
Solution:
Let the radius of the circular field be r and radius of the field with the path be R
124

Sor = 5 metre = 62 metre and R = (62 + 6) metre = 63 metre
Area of the circular field = 7r? and area of the circular field with the path = wR?
.. Area of the path = Area of field with path — Area of
the field 6
= (7R* — mr?) = w(R? — 1?)
= 3.1416(68 — 622) = 3.1416(4624 — 3844)
= 3.1416 x 780 = 2450.44 square metre (approx.)
The required area of the path is 2450.44 square metre
(approx.)
