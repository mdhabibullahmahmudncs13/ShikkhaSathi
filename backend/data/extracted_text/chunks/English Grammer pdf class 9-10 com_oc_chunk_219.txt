B The main function of an adverb is to modify a verb. But it has some
other subsidiary functions too. Look at the following examples:
This mango is very sweet.
You have done quite well.
Nearly everybody was late.
The grapes were well within my reach.
| can’t go there just because I'miill.
Fortunately, he survived the accident.
Notice the items after the adverbs in these sentences. You can then see that
adverbs may modify an adjective (sweet), another adverb (well), a pronoun
(everybody), a preposition (within), a conjunction (because) and a sentence
5] (he survived the accident). These are the different functions of an adverb.
