Chapter 15. Area Related Theorems and Constructions 313
Proof: The area of AABC = 3 x AB x CL and
The area of AABE = 3 x AB x EK
CL = EK, [by construction AL || FC]
.. The area of AABC = The area of AABE
Ed 3 area of the parallelogram ABCD = 3 area of the parallelogram ABEF.
.-. Area of the parallelogram ABC'D = area of the parallelogram ABEF. (proved)
Theorem 38. Pythagoras Theorem
In a right-angled triangle, the area of the square drawn on the hypotenuse is equal
to the sum of the areas of the squares drawn on the other two sides.
Special Nomination: Let ABC be a right
angled triangle in which ZACB is a right angle G 4
and hypotenuse is AB. It is to be proved that, c
