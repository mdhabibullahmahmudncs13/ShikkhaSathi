========================================

W =Fs
According to Newton’s second law we know,
F=ma
Again, from the equations of motion we know that if an object starts its motion
from rest,
Then s = Sat? and v = at
Then work, W = Fs = mas = ma X Sat? = Sma? = Fm?
Therefore we can say if a force / makes a displacement s of an object then the
kinetic energy that is generated:
1
T= Sm?
Zmv
The velocity v is in the square form in kinetic energy, so to double the velocity
of an object we will need to apply four times of the energy.
‘When learning the equations of motion, we noticed that
v2 =u? + 2as
