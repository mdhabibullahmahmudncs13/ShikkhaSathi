========================================

have the same vertex A, a common side AC and A D
are on opposite sides of AC. ZBAC and ZC AD are
adjacent angles.
Perpendicular and Right angle
If two adjacent angles are on the same line and equal,
then each of the related adjacent angle is a right
angle or 90° : The two sides of a right angle are mutually
perpendicular. In the adjacent figure two angles Cc
ZBAC and ZDAC are produced at the point A of
BD by the ray AC. A is the vertex of these two
angles.
AC is the common side of the angles ZBAC and B A D
ZDAC. The tow angles lie on the tow sides of the
common side AC. If ZBAC and ZDAC are equal,
then each of the two angles is right angle. The line
segments AC and BD are mutually perpendicular.
