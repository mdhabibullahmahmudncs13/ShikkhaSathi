238 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Again, (3z —2y)? = (3x +2y)* —4- 3x -2y
or, (3 —2y)? = (3 + 2y)% — 24ay
or, (3z — 2y)? = (700)% — 24 x 20000
or, (3x — 2y)* = 490000 — 480000
or, (3x — 2y)% = 10000
or, 3x —2y = 100 ...(2)
By subtracting (2) from (1) we get,
4y = 600 or, y = 150
.. the breadth of the given land is 2y = 2 x 150 = 300 metres.
