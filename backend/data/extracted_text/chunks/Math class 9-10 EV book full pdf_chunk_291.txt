In modern geometry, we take a point, a line and a plane as undefined terms and
some of their properties are also admitted to be true. These admitted properties
are called geometric postulates. These postulates are chosen in such a way that
they are consistent with real conception. The five postulates of Euclid are:
Postulate 1: A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other
point.
Postulate 2: A terminated line can be produced indefinitely.

Postulate 4: All right angles are equal to one another.
Postulate 5: If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior
angles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the
