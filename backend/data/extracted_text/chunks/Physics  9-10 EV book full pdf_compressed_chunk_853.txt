Current Electricity 321
The conducting wires that are used to carry electricity from one place to other
have at least some minimum resistance. When current (/) flows through a
resistance (R), heat (IR) is generated and this is loss of electrical energy. This
loss is called system loss. We have already discussed that if electricity is
supplied at high voltage then for a definite electrical energy, loss is reduced
because of resistive heat energy. That is why electricity produced in the power
plants is transformed into high voltage using step up transformers. Before
distributing the electrical energy for customer use, the electrical supply is again
brought down to a suitable voltage using a step down transformer.
