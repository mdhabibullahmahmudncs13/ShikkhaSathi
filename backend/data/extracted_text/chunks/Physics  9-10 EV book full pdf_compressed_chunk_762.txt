========================================

are drawn in a plane (Fig Figure 10.11: Lines of force diverges from

10.11). positive charge and converges into negative

There are some rules of charge

drawing lines of forces:

(a) In case of positive charge the lines of forces emerges from positive charges,
and in case of negative charge converges into negative charges . In a specific
point, the direction of tangent line of force is the direction of electric field.

(b) The more the amount of charge, per unit volume or area the more the number
of lines of forces.

(c) The nearer the lines of force, the more the magnitude of the electric field.

(d) The lines of force of one charge never intercept the lines of force of another
charge.

In Figure 10.12 (a), the lines of force of two opposite charges are shown. You
