========================================

water is vaporized and turbine is rotated with the help of this vapor and
electricity is produced from the generator. This type of power plant is called a
nuclear power plant. It is possible to get thousands of megawatt power from such
a power plant very easily. The wastage material that is produced after the nuclear
reaction is terribly radioactive; so many types of precautionary measures have to
be taken when processing them. If the excess neutrons that emerge after a
nuclear reaction are absorbed somewhere else by any means, then the nuclear
reaction ceases. There is a special type of rod called a control rod to absorb the
neutrons in a nuclear reactor. These are used to control the nuclear reactor.
