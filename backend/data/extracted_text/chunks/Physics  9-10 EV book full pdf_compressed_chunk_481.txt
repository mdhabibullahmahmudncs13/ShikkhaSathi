========================================

absolute zero temperature as zero Kelvin.
To make any scale of temperature two certain temperatures (or fixed points) are
needed. In the Kelvin scale one is absolute zero which is taken as zero degree.
Another one is the triple point of water. At this temperature and at a certain
pressure (0.0060373 atm) ice, water and water vapour can exist together, so this
temperature can be defined very accurately. In the Celsius scale its value is 0.01
°C and to make the similarity with Celsius scale its value is 273.16° in Kelvin
scale.
Besides, the Kelvin and Celsius scales there is an another scale called the
Fahrenheit scale in which the temperature of fusion of ice and vaporization of
water are 32°F and 212°F respectively. In the figure 6.02 three scales are shown
