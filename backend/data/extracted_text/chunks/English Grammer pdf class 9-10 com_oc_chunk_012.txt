These are common nouns. A common noun refers to every person, place or
thing of the same class or kind. It does not refer to anything in particular. For
example, the noun ‘girl’ may mean any girl in the world. A common noun can
be both singular and plural. For example:
London is a big city.
There are many big cities in the world.
Note: A proper noun can be used as a common noun. Look at the following
examples:
He is called the Shakespeare (= the greatest dramatist) of Bangladesh.
