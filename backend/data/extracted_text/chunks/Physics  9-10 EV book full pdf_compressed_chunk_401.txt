5.3.1 Archimedes principle and
It is sure all of you know =F
Archimedes principle and the story [AY ass 4
behind this. The principle is easy, SUR:
‘If a body is immersed in a liquid, a g
the weight of the body is reduced by [—— 4
an amount equal to the displaced Ig i
liquid’. Now we "ll find this principle. A
A cylinder is immersed in some
amount of liquid is shown in figure
5.04 (This can be any object of any
shape, but for convenience of
calculation we took a cylinder). Let
us suppose that the height of the Figure 5.04: The weight of a body is
cylinder is /, cross-sectional area of reduced by an amount equal to the weight
top and bottom of the cylinder is 4. of the displaced water.
We imagine that the cylinder is
