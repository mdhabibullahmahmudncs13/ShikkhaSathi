8.6.1 Image on concave mirror
Now we have entered the most exciting part! In plane mirrors and convex
mirrors only one type of image was formed. Two types of images can be formed
on a concave mirror. If an object is placed within the focal distance it forms one
type of image, if it is placed at a distance greater than the focal distance it creates
another type of image.
Before starting that, let us know how light rays reflect from a spherical concave
mirror. If we know the rules of reflection of three special light rays in a concave
mirror, we can explain how the image is formed:
(i) If light ray travels along the radius or starts from the center (Figure 8.22,
OP or ON ray), it will reflect perpendicularly and go back the way it has
come.
