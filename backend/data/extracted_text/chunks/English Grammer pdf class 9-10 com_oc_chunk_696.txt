========================================

not only assess the paragraph only from the perspective of grammar accuracy.
Moreover, use of cohesion (inter-connectedness of the sentences) and coherence
(transition from one idea to another idea) are important here. Word limit here will be
similar to paragraph writing.
14. Open-Ended Questions
Open ended or essay format questions are excellent for measuring higher level
cognitive learning and overall comprehension of a reading text/passage. They allow the
student to select content for their response, to organize their thoughts in a logical
manner and to present their ideas on a given subject matter. Overall, these types of test
questions allow teachers to test student's broader understanding of a reading item.
