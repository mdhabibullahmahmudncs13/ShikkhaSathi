========================================

finishing the task, if it is required to take a print out by a different printing

machine, it should be copied on CD or pen-drive. The size of the file will be
small for getting this task done smoothly. The size of the file will be
comparatively small if the layers can be combined.

To combine layers

- There are three commands called Merge Visible, Flatten Image. and Merge
Down on the pop-up of the Layers palette.

- If any layer 18 invisible, give the command of Merge Visible, and only the
visible layers will be combined.

- If the Merge Down command is given, the selected layer and the layer below
of it will be combined.

- Ifyou choose Flatten Image. all the layers will be combined.
