1.45. With what angle will the ray of |
light emerge if there is air on the other aA

A | m=145
side . H
Answer : We know ENED
ny sind; = n, sin, | 0;
1.45 X sin75° = 1X sin0, |

sinf, = 1.40
We know the value of sin 0, will not be greater than 1, but here it happens
because light is totally reflected without refracting . Therefore whenever we
want to see the refraction of light from a denser medium to a rarer medium then
it is better to determine the critical angle first. If light incidents at an angle less
than this critical angle, only then it is possible to get refraction.
