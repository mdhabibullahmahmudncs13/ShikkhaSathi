Chapter 5. Equations in One Variable 99
Ifaset, S={r:2€ R11 <x <10}, z-may be any real number from 1 to 10.
Here, a is a variable. So, we can say that when a letter symbol means the element
of a set, it is called variable.
Degree of an equation : The highest degree of a variable in any equation
is called the degree of the equation. Degree of each of the equations = + 1 =
5, 2e—1=ua+5, y+7=2y—3is 1; these are linear equations with one variable.
Again, the degree of each of the equations 2% + 52 +6 = 0, y? —y = 12, 4a” —
2x = 3 — 6x is 2; these are linear equations with two variable. The equation
22% — 2% — dz +4 = 0 is the equation of degree 3 with one variable.
