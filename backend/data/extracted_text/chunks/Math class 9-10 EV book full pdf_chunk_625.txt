Finite Series
The term ‘order’ is widely used in our day to day life. For example, the concept
of order is used to arrange the commodities in the shops, to arrange the events of
drama and ceremony, to keep the commodities in attractive way in the godown.
Again, to make many tasks easier and attractive, we use large to small, child to
old, light to heavy etc. types of order. Mathematical series have been originated
from these concepts of order. In this chapter, the relation between sequence and
series and contents related to them have been presented.
At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to —

» describe the sequence and series and determine the differences between them.

» explain finite series.
