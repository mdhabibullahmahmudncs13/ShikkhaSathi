========================================

is called the incident ray (XO). The
ray which is reflected (OX) is called fir etm
the reflected ray. (You are realizing 9] P
that the ray which enters the second
medium is the refracted ray- we will
not discuss it in this chapter). The second medium
angle between the incident ray and Ben
the normal is called the incident
angle (0,) and the angle between the
reflected ray and the normal is the Figur 8.03: Reflection of light from first to
reflected angle (0). Now we can second medium
state the two laws of reflection:
First Law: The reflected ray will be in the plane which we imagined
through the incident ray and the normal.
Second Law: The reflected angle is equal to the incident angle.
