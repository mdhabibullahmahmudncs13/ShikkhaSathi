the headlight of a motor
car. If the potential difference between the two ends of the filament is 12 V, what
is the resistance?
16. The electromotive force of a dry cell is 1.5 V. What is the energy spent by the
cell in driving 0.5 C of charge round the circuit?
17. What are fixed and variable resistors?
18. What do you understand by electromotive force and potential difference?
1. Make a 2 Q resistor using infinite number of 1 Q resistor.
2. Using nichrome sheet of 1 mm thickness, your friend has made a resistor of
10 cm x 10 cm square (Figure 11.18). You have made a resistor of Im x1m
square. What is the value of the resistance made by your friend? What is the
value of your resistance?
