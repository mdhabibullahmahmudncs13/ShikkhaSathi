Chapter 14. Ratio, Similarity and Symmetry 297
Proof:
. AB AC AB AC
Since DE- DF Therefore ap = aq
Therefore PQ || BC [theorem 29]
 LABC = ZAPQ [ corresponding angles made by the transversal AB]
and ZACB = ZAQP | corresponding angles made by the transversal AC]
SL AABC and AAPQ are equiangular.
Therefore, — = = or, 2 = = [theorem 32]
But AB BC [supposition]
DE ~ EF PP
. BC BC
“EF PQ
EF =PQ
Therefore AAPQ and ADEF are congruent. [SSS theorem]
 LPAQ = LEDF, ZAPQ = ZDEF, ZAQP = Z/DFE
o LAPQ = ZABC and ZAQP = ZACB
JA=/D, /B=/E /C=/F
Theorem 34. If one angle of a triangle is equal to an angle of the other and
the sides adjacent to the equal angles are proportional, the triangles are similar.
AB AC
ial Nomination: Let in AABC and ADEF, ZA = /D and —— = —.
