Refraction of light 259
That point is called the focal point and the distance from the focal point and the
center of lens is called the focal length. (Figure 9.18)
In case of a convex mirror, light is incident from one side. In the case of a
lens, light can be incident on it from both sides. Every lens has a focal length
.The focal length of a lens remains the same whichever direction the light is
incident on it. If parallel light
incidents on this lens, the rays spread
out, and appear to diverge from focal 0
point. If the direction of the rays of "
light is reversed then they goes back a
through the direction they came. So if -
we can reverse the direction of — >
divergent rays, then they will emerge os: >—
in parallel and will go in the inverted —7
