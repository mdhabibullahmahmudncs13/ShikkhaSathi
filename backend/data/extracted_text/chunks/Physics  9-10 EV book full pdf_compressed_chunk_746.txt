You have understood by now why they happen.
The event of the comb has been explained. The crawling of the little baby is also
easy to understand. Due to friction with the carpet, charge accumulates in its
body and spreads to the hair also. All hairs have same charge. We know similar
charge repulses, so each hair repulses each other and becomes straightened. Now
we can explain the event of the thunderbolt too. Due to friction among clouds,
charge gets separated. When a large amount of charge is accumulated in the
clouds, it creates induction of opposite charge below. Sometimes that is so large
. in amount, it becomes connected with the clouds by piercing the air. We call this
§ lightning. (Figure 10.07).
