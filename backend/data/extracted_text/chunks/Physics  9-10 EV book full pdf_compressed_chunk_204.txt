of small nucleuses a huge amount of energy can be produced due to this force.
For this reason a nuclear bomb has so much energy. By this force light and heat
is produced in the sun.

According to scientists these four types of forces have the same origin and they are
trying to explain all these forces by a single law. Meanwhile, it has become
possible to explain the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force by a
single law. This is a tremendous success of theoretical physics. (Therefore, you
can say, forces are of three types: gravitation, electro-weak and nuclear force.
Nobody will say it is wrong). The scientists are trying to unify the other forces
too by a single law.
