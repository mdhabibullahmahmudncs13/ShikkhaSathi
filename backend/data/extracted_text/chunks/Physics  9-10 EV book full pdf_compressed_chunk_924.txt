========================================

Cy: 6 protons and 8 neutrons
Among these three isotopes, C,, is unstable or radioactive.
In 1896, Henry Becquerel discovered the existence of radioactive rays from
Uranium for the first time. Later on, Ernest Rutherford, Pierre Curie, Marie
Curie and other scientists discovered radioactivity of other elements. Since
radioactivity it is not influenced by external pressure, heat, electric or magnetic
field, and cannot be controlled, it is accepted as a nuclear phenomenon. Due to
radioactivity, radioactive rays emerge and this changes the structure of the
nucleus and turn it into a different element, this is also observed.
The main three radioactive rays that emit from the nucleus are alpha, beta and
gamma rays (Figure 13.01).
