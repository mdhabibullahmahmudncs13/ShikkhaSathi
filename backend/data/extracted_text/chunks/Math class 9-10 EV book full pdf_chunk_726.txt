Chapter 15. Area Related Theorems and Constructions 315
Drawing: Bisect the line segment BC at E. At the point E of the line segment
EC, draw CEF equal to Zz. Through A, draw AG parallel to BC which intersects
the ray EF at F. Again, through C, draw the ray CG parallel to EF which
intersects the ray AG at GG. Hence, ECGF is the required parallelogram.
Proof: Join A, E .
Now, area of AABE = area of AAEC|[since base BE = base EC and heights
of both the triangles are equal].
area of AABC = 2 (area of AAEC).
Again, area of the parallelogram ECGF = 2 (area of AAEC) [since both lie on
the same base EC and EC || AG).
area of the parallelogram region ECGF = area of AABC.
Again ZOEF = Zax[since EF||C'B by construction].
So the parallelogram ECGF is the required parallelogram.
