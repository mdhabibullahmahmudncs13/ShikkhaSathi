new quantity called efficiency. Efficiency can be expressed in percentage as:
_- __ amount of work __ amount of work —energy wasted
Efficiency = rT — Xx 100 = E——— xX 100
0) Example
Question: If an object of mass 10 kg is lifted 10 min 15 s using a motor of 1000
W, then what is the amount of wasted energy? What is its efficiency?
Answer:
Amount of work: 10 xX 9.8 x 10] = 9,800]
Energy given: 1000 x 15] = 15,000]
Energy wasted: 15,000 — 9,800 = 5,200
Effici = 800) X 100% = 65.3 %
iciency = 15,000] 0 = 653%
You will be surprised to know that, energy is wasted in every step of production
of electricity in a power plant, and if all these wastage is taken into account,
the efficiency of the power plant can drop down to 30%.
