========================================

the mid-value of the class.
Midovalue of the class — Class upper hl lower value
If the class mid-value is 2;(¢ = 1...k) the mid-value related table will be as
follows:
Class interval | Class mid-value (z;) | Frequency (f;)
% 31 17.5
35-4
15-51
1190
65-74 2085

Arithmetic mean of classified data (short-cut method): The short-cut
method is easy for determining arithmetic mean of classified data. The steps to
determine mean by short-cut method are :
1. To find the mid-value of classes.
2. To take convenient approximated mean (a) from the mid-values.
3. To determine steps deviation, the difference between class mid-values and
approximate mean are divided by the class interval i.e.
