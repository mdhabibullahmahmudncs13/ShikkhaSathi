Starting, the Journey of Programming in Python:
To write instructions or code in Python, we need to perform some tasks to set up
the programming environment:
1. We need to download the Python application and install it on our computer,
Python can be downloaded from this link.
https://www.python.org/downloads/
Afterthat, we download the latest version from there.
2. Once the application is downloaded, we proceed to stall it. During the
installation, we will see a window like the one below:
