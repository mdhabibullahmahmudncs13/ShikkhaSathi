Chapter 3. Algebraic Expressions 71
According to the question, u + v = z cee (1)
ty
and u—v = — cee (2)
t
Adding equations (1) and (2) we get,
21 Iii, 1,1 or u=" 1,1

Example 37. A pipe can fill up an empty tank in 12 minutes. Another pipe
flows out 14 litre of water per minute. If the two pipes are opened together and
the empty tank is filled up in 96 minutes, how much water does the tank contain 7.
Solution: Let x litre of water flows in per minute by the first pipe and the tank
can contain y litre of water.
