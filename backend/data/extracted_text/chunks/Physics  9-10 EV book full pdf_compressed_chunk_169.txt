8. Let the marble, pencil or pen roll on the inclined plane again. Measure
the time by counting the numbers and calculate the speed again. Increase
the slope gradually and calculate the average speed every time.

9. Draw a graph by plotting sin along the X-axis and average speed along
Y-axis. From the graph calculate the speed for any slope.
