straight lines. Each of these perpendicular straight lines is called axis. The line
XOX’ parallel to horizon is called z-axis, and vertical line YOY” is called
y-axis and point O of intersection of these lines is called Origin.
The signed perpendicular distance of a point, located in the plane determined by
two axes, from the axes are called coordinates of the point. Let P be any point
on the plane determined by two axes. Let us draw perpendiculars PN and PM
from P to XOX’ and YOY’. Then PM = ON which is perpendicular distance to
YOY” from P and PN = OM which is perpendicular distance from P to XOX".
If PM = 2 and PN = y, then coordinates of point P are (x,y).
