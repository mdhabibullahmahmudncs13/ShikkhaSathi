18. A system of simple equations is r +y = 10, 3z —2y = 0
1) Show that the equations are consistent. How many solutions do they
have?
2) Solving the system of equations, find (x,y) .
3) Find the area of the triangle formed by the straight lines indicated by
the equations with the X- axis.

19. If 7 is added to the numerator of a fraction, the value of the fraction is
the integer 2. Again, if 2 is subtracted from the denominator, value of the
