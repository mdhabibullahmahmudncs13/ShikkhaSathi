========================================

- We also use the present perfect continuous for an activity that began in
the past and has very recently finished:
I've been cleaning the kitchen. (I'm still sweating, and | still have the
gloves on.)
The two boys have been fighting again. (The room is a terrible mess.)
- We also use it for repeated events up to now:
I've been playing the guitar since | was seven.
Dr. Sayeed has been treating my father for years.
