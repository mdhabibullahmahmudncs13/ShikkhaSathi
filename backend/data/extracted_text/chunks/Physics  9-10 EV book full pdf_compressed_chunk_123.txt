========================================

can be expressed by a single number only. Besides position you will find the
other examples of vectors are velocity and force. You will be introduced with
velocity and force in the next chapter. Because to express these quantities,
direction is to be mentioned along with its magnitude.
To differentiate vector quantities from scalar quantities they are written in bold
font (e.g. x, y or A, B). In books or in computer printing it is easy to write
anything in bold form. But when anyone writes on a paper then to express
anything as vector, a small arrow is used over it (%,¥ or A,B).
In this book the physics you will be taught will not involve application of
vectors. At best you will be reminded which one is scalar and which one is a
. vector.
