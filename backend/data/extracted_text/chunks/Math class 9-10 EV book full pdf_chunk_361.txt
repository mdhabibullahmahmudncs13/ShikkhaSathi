Chapter 7. Practical Geometry 151
Drawing:
1. From any ray DF, cut the part DE equalto p——————
the perimeter p. Make angles ZEDL equal A A
to Zz and ZDEM equal to Zy on the same * 7
side of the line segment DE at D and E. B I"
2. Draw the bisectors DG and EH of the two HAG
angles.
3. Let these bisectors DG and EH intersect pj a F
at a point A. At the point A, draw I
ZDAB equal to ZADE and ZEAC equal HAG
to ZAED.
4. Let the rays AB and AC intersects DE at F
. . D B Cc E
the point B and C' respectively.
Then, AABC' is the required triangle.
Proof: In AABD, ZADB = ZDAB [by construction]
LAB =DB
Again, AACE, ZAEC = ZEAC
LCA=CE
Therefore, AABC, AB + BC + CA=DB+ BC+ CE =DE =p
ZABC = ZADB + /DAB = x + 1 = Zr
1 1
and ZACB = ZAEC + Z/EAC = 54Y + 54 =Zy
