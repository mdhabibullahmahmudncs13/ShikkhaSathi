Figure 13.05 : Silicon crystal. Three dimentional silicon crystal (right)
In Figure 13.05 many atoms of a semiconductor have been shown side by side.
Due to the structure of the atom if there are eight electrons in their outer most
shells, in one sense they are fulfilled and become very stable. Atoms always try
to have eight electrons in their outer most shells. Silicon is the most used
semiconductor among the semiconductors. The number of electrons is four in its
outer most shell. But when we observe a silicon crystal, we find surprisingly that
there are eight electrons in the outer most shell of every atom! It has happened
because every atom attaches to four different atoms around it, and they are all
