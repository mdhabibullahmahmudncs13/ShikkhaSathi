Grammar point
Will and won't are used to predict a future event which is seen as certain:
My family and | will go to attend my cousin's wedding tomorrow.
We will meet at the school ground at 7.00.
Note that in conversations we usually use won't in place of will not.
Also we don’t generally use will not in negative questions. Instead, we say,
‘Won't you come to see me off at the airport?’
We use would for invitations, requests, and for polite conversations:
Would you like to join us for the river cruise? I'd love to.
What would you like to have, tea or coffee?
We usually use the contracted form of would ('d) after words ending in a vowel
sound:
I'd/ we'd/ he'd/she’d, etc.
But we don’t say, Jt'd’ (x), instead, we'd say ‘It would’.
