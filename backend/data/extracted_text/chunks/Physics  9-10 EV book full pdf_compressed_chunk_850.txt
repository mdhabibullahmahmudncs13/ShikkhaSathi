========================================

Spent energy = 60 x (5 x 30)/1000 unit=9 unit
Total cost of electricity with 10 taka per unit = 9 x 10 taka = 90 taka
11.4 Electrical Supply
When current needs to be transmitted from one place to another in a country, it
is transformed into a very high voltage. This is done to reduce the loss of
electricity in electrical wires. You know that, the amount of energy wasted per
second as heat energy is equal to 2R , so we may conclude that there would be
no dissipation of energy as heat energy if there was no resistance R in electrical
wires.
But that is not practically possible; everything has some resistance. That is why,
if current I can be reduced, the energy lost /2R due to heat can also be reduced.
Since the amount of electrical energy supplied per second is VI, if the
