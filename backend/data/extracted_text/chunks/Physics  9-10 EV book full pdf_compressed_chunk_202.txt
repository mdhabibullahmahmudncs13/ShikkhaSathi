========================================

can attract only, cannot repulse. It is so much stronger than gravitational force
(10° times, or trillion trillion trillion times stronger). That the statement is true,
you can definitely guess. Because when you comb your hair by a comb and pull
a piece of paper by attraction, the whole earth tries to pull the piece of paper
by the gravitational force due to its total mass. But the small amount of
electricity in your comb defeats the total gravitational pull of the giant earth.
3.2.3 Weak Nuclear Force or Weak Force
It is called weak because it is weaker than the electromagnetic force
(approximately trillion times weaker) but not at all weak like the gravitational
force. The force of gravitation and the electromagnetic force can act from any
