Example 32. If the length of diagonal of the surface of a cube is 8v/2 cm,
determine the length of its diagonal and volume.
Solution:
Let, the side of the cube is a.
The length of diagonal of the surface = v/2a. Length of diagonal = v/3a and
volume = a*
As per question, V2a = 8v2 or,a=38
The length of the cube’s diagonal = v/3 x 8 = 13.856 cm (approx.)
and volume = 8% = 512 cube cm.
The required length of the diagonal is 13.856 cm (approx.) and volume 512
cubic cm.
Example 33. The length of a rectangle is 12 ecm and width 5 cm. Determine
the area of its whole surface and the volume of the solid that is formed by revolving
the rectangle around its greater side.
Solution: Given that, the length of a rectangle is 12 cm. and width 5 em. If it
