Proof: According to the construction, FEBCF is a rectangular region.
In triangle ABC: the base and height are BC' and BE respectively.
Hence, A region ABC = 3 x BC'x BE... (i)
In triangle DBC; the base and height are BC'and C'F respectively.
1
A region DBC'= 3 xBCxCF= 3 x BCxBE... (i) ['.- EBCF rectangule]
Comparing (i) and (ii)
A region ABC = A region DBC' (proved)
Corollary 1. If the areas of triangular regions lying on the same base and same
side are equal, the triangles lie between the same pair of parallel lines.
Corollary 2. Area of a triangle is exactly half of the area of a parallelogram lying
on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines.
Hints: In the figure, ABCD is a parallelogram with AC as diagonal.
