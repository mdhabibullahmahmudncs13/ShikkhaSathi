========================================

In answering the question, an examinee does not need to reproduce the text in the
answer script. Writing the missing word with the corresponding question number is
enough. However, the whole text with suitable words in the gaps will neither earn any
extra credit or discredit.
6. Information Transfer
Depending on the level of difficulty and length of the text, information transfer and
True/False questions can be set from the same text. However, if the text is too small, do
not use the same text for both the tests as the content will be inadequate for setting
questions. Make sure there is no overlapping or repetitions in the question you have set.
Alternatively you can use two different texts for these two test items.
