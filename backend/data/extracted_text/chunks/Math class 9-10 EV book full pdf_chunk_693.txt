========================================

alternative method.
Example 1. Divide a line segment of length 7 ¢ m internally in the ratio 3: 2.
Solution: Draw any ray AG. From AG, cut a
line segment AB = 7 ¢ m. Draw an angle ZBAX x
C
at A. From AX, cut the lengths AE = 3 c.m. B
and EC = 2 cm from EX. Join B,C. At >
E, draw an ZAED equal to ZACB whose side 2
intersects AB at D. Then the line segment AB 4 3) 3G
is divided at D internally in the ratio 3 : 2.
‘Work:
3

2)
of the given triangle.
