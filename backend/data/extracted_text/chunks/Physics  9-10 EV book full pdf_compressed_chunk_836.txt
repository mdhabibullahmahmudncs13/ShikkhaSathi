========================================

TR O5Q+10Q+15Q 5
So, voltage difference from A to B, 1

Vi=RI=5QxZA=1V
So, the voltage at A is 6V and 1V less at B so, the voltage at B is,
6V-V,=6V—-1V=5V
As the voltage of point B is 5 V, then the voltage of point E is also 5 V. Similarly,
1

Va = Ry =10Qxz A =2V
The voltage at C is 2 V less than voltage of point B. So, voltage of point C is,
5V-2V=3V
We have said earlier that the voltage of point D is zero. This can also be verified.
The voltage of point D is less than point C by V,.

So, voltage of point A 8 c
