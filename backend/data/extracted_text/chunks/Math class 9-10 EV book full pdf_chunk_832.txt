Example 3. The frequency distribution table of the weights (in Kg) of 60
students of class X of a school is given below:
Weight (Kg) 5 — 60 66-70
Frequency (No. of students)
1) Draw the histogram of frequency distribution.
2) Draw frequency polygon of the histogram.
Solution: The class interval of the data in the table is discrete. If the class
interval are made indiscrete, the table will be :
Class interval of the weight (in Kg) |In Discrete class interval | Mid point of class
IE] 55-0
5-55
EE S5-o08
5 0565
w= EE NT
1) Histogram has been drawn taking each square of graph paper as 5 unit of
class interval along with z-axis and frequency along with y-axis. The class
interval along with z-axis has started from 45.5. The broken segments A
