The sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers
Let S,, be the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers.
That is, S, = 13 +25 + 3% +... +n?
We know that, (r +1) — (r—1)2 = (r?+2r+1)— (r? = 2r +1) = 4r
or, (r+ 1)%r? —r2(r — 1)? = 4r - r* = 4 [ Multiplying both the sides by 7]
We get, in the above identity, putting, r = 1,2,3,--- ,n
22.1212. 02 =4-1%
32.22 22.12 =4.2%
42.32 32.922 =4.33
(n+1)2-n? =n? (n—1)? = 4n*
Adding we get,
(n+1)% m2 —12-0°=4(1% +22 + 3 + --- +n?)
or, (n+1)?-n? =48,
n*(n +1)?
