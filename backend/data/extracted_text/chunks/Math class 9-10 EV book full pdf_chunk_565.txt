two equations be solved?
Here, if both sides of first equation are multiplied by 2, we shall get the
second equation. Again, if both sides of second equation are divided by
2, we shall get the first equation. That is, the two equations are mutually
dependent.
‘We know, the first equation has infinite number of solutions. So, the second
equation has also the same infinite number of solutions. Such systems of
equations are called consistent and mutually dependent. Such systems of
equations have infinite number of solutions. Here, comparing the coefficients

of x and y, and the constant terms of the two equations, we get, 1-33

C120 2
That is, in the case of the system of such simultaneous equations, the ratios
become equal.
