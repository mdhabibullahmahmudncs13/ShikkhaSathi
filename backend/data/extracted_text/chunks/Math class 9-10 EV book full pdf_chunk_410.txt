Chapter 8. Circle 173
Exercise 8.2
1. ABCD is a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle with centre O. If the diagonals
AC and BD intersect at the point E, prove that ZAOB+/C0OD = 2/AEB.
2. ABCD is a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle with centre O where ZADB +
/ZBDC = 1 right angle. Prove that, A, O and C' lie in the same straight
line.
3. Show that, the oblique sides of a cyclic trapezium are equal.
4. In the figure, the centre of the circle is O and
OB =25cm. A
1) Evaluate the parameter of the circle
ABCD. 1
2) Prove that ZBAD = 5/BOD LAN ;
B
3) If AC and BD intersect at the point NT
E, prove that, ZAOB + ZCOD = C
2/AEB.
5. Two chords AB and C'D of the circle ABC'D intersect at the point E. Show
that, AAED and ABEC' are equiangular.
