Proof:

1. Place ZABC on ZDEF in such a way that point A coincides with point
D, and side AB coincides with side DE. Point C will fall on the same side
of DE as point F. Since AB=DE, point B will coincide with point E.

2. Since /ZBAC=/EDF and side AB coincides with side DE, side AC will
coincide with side DF (by angle equality).

3. Since AC=DF, point C will coincide with point F (by side equality).

4. Now, since point B coincides with point E and point C coincides with
point F, side BC will completely coincide with side EF.

Therefore, ZABC coincides with ZDEF.

.. ZABC=/DEF (Proved)

Theorem 7

If two sides of a triangle are equal, then the angles opposite those sides are also

equal.

Special Nomination: Suppose in triangle ABC, AB=AC.
