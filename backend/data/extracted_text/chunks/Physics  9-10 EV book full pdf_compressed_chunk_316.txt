Work, Power, Energy 109
Answer: This has been done before with the help of the laws of motin. Now it
can be done by the transformation of energy.
ineti ay: 1, 1 ;
Kinetic energy: = 5mv? = =x10x100%] =50,000]
When the object reaches a height 4, at this height the kinetic energy has been
totally converted into potential energy. So,
mgh = 50000]
he 50,000] _ 50,000 _
=Tmg  1ox9g mTom
For your understanding the mass 10 kg is mentioned here. But it does not depend
on the mass. With any mass we will get this answer. For this we might have used
the formula v=2gh directly.
Question: A body of mass 5 kg is thrown in the upward direction with a velocity
of 50 m/s. At what height will the potential and kinetic energy be the same?
Answer: Initial kinetic energy of the body is
