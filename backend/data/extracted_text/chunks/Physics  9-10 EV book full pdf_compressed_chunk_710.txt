rays (in the case of light, it is always true that if the light goes from A to B and if
the direction of the ray is changed, it will always go from B to A). Now let us find
the position of the image for different positions of an object .

converge at the focal point. makes the rays parallel.
Before starting, let us learn how light ray refracts in a convex lens. If we know
three special rules of the refraction of light through convex lens, we can describe
how the image is formed .

(i) If the rays of light is centripetal (Figure 9.23, YO or XO ray) it goes
