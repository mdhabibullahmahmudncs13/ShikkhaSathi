========================================

c = 27r, where 7 = 3.14159265--- which is an
irrational number. Value of 7 = 3.1416 is used as
the approximate value. Therefore, if the radius of a
circle is known, we can find the approximate value of
the circumference of the circle by using the value of
TT.
