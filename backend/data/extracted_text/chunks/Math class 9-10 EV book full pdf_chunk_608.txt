========================================

line.
Let the two straight lines intersect each other at P. It is seen from the picture
that the coordinates of P are (2,0).
.. solution: = = 2
Work: Find four points on the graph of the equation 2z —y —3 = 0 in
terms of a table. Then, taking unit of a fixed length on the graph paper, plot
the points and join them each other. Is the graph a straight line?
Exercise 12.3
Solve by graphs:
