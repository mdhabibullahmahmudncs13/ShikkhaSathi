Mathematical questions

1. Scientist Celsius introduced a thermometer in which the boiling point of ice was
100° C and the boiling point of water was 0” C! At which temperature the readings
in Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are equal?

2. At which temperature will the density of gold decrease to 0.001% ?

3. The temperature of water increased by 15° C after a piece of hot iron of mass 1
gm at temperature 30° C was put into water of 1 liter. What was the temperature
of the piece of iron?

4. If 10 J heat is supplied per second to a piece of ice of 1gm at temperature 0°C,
how long it takes to vaporize the ice?
