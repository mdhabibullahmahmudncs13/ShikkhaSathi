========================================

AB and CD respectively. It is to be proved that if pd
OE = OF, AB = CD ANB
Drawing: Join O, A and O,C'.
Proof:
Step 1. Since OF 1 AB and OF L C'D
Therefore, ZOEA = ZOFC =1 right angle.
Step 2. Now in the right angled triangles AOAE and AOCF
hypotenuse OA = hypotenuse OC' [radius of same circle]
and
OF = OF [supposition]
SL AOAE = AOCF [RHS theorem)
LAE =CF
Step 3. AE = SAB and CF = 5CD [.- The perpendicular from the centre
bisects the chord]
Step 4. Therefore, JAB = top :
" i.e., AB=CD (Proved)
E Corollary 3. The diameter is the greatest chord of a circle.
