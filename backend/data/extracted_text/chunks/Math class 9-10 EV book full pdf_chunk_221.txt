first significant
digit
0.6237 [6.237 x 10°! (0+) =-1=1
0.06237 | 6.237 x 102 —(1+1)=-2=2
0.006237 | 6.237 x 10° -2+1)=-3=3
Note: Characteristic may be either positive or negative, but mantissa will always
be positive.
Example 11. Find the characteristics of log of the following numbers :
1) 5570 2) 45.70 3) 0.4305 4) 0.000435
Solution:
1) 5570 = 5.570 x 1000 = 5.570 x 10°
.. Characteristic of log of the number is 3
Otherwise, the number of digits in the number 5570 is 4.
.". Characteristic of log of the number is =4 —1=3
2) 45.70 = 4.570 x 10*
.". Characteristic of log of the number is 1
