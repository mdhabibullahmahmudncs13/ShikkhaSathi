Chapter 6. Lines, Angles and Triangles 135
Corollary 4. The acute angles of a right angled triangle are complementary to
each other.
‘Work:
Prove that if a side of a triangle is extended, the exterior angle so formed is
greater than each of the two interior opposite angles.
Congruence of Sides and Angles
If two line segments have the same length, they Ae—8
are congruent. Conversely, if two line segments ¢ b
are congruent, they have the same length. .
If the measurement of two angles is equal, the ; p
angles are congruent. Conversely, if two angles p 40’ a 40°
are congruent, their measurement is the same. W 4 ow
Congruence of Triangles
If a triangle when placed on another exactly A
covers the other, the triangles are congruent. The
