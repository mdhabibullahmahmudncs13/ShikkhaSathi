========================================

are the main components in ICT. A new computer, be it a desktop, laptop or
tablet, usually runs fast, but afler some days, it gradually slows down. As it gets
old, it becomes slow. Sometimes, you have to wait for a long time after giving a
command. Sometimes the situation is so bad that vou want to buy a new one.
‘What is the way to resolve this situation? Here lies the importance of computer
maintenance. You have to learn a little about computer maintenance in the junior
classes. Most of the people do not like the task of maintaining ICT or
technological devices. Tlowever, it is an important task. If yon want to keep your
ICT device operative, you have to maintain it. You need not to be an expert for
that job. We are talking about software-oriented maintenance of ICT devices.
