========================================

does not burst but air is coming out.
We mentioned about pressure of gas but didn’t explain its reason. We can
explain the reason of pressure by the molecular kinetic theory. If a gas is kept in
a closed space then it puts a pressure on the walls of the container, this can be
explained with the help of the molecular kinetic theory of substance. In a closed
region the molecules of a gas starts moving randomly and every time it hits the
walls of the container it goes back due to reflection. Therefore a gas molecule
hits the wall with a particular momentum, and returns back with a different
momentum. You know to change the momentum of an object; a force has to be
applied on that object. Hitting the wall, the gas molecules apply a force on the
