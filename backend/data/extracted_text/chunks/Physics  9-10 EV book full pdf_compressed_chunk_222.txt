The result is terrible. After the collision, the truck will move with the same
velocity, i.e. it will not experience the horrible nature of the collision. The
velocity of the small car will be changed from —u to 3u, that means change of
velocity is 3u- (-u)=4u, the direction of the velocity of small car will be changed
and it will fly off with four times its velocity in the reverse direction. In this
process the small car will be crumpled and destroyed. The loss of lives of the
passengers will be a very natural consequence. Again, we assume that no other
