========================================

ABCDEF --- is a regular polygon whose centre is
O. It has n sides and the length of cach side is a. D
We join O, A:and O, B. E
Let height of AAOB, ON = h and ZOAB =10 0
The angle produced at each of the vertices of regular F N c
polygon = 26 iN
.. Total angle produced by n number of vertices in AN B
the polygon = 26n
Angle produced in the polygon at the centre = 4 right angles.
.-. The sum of angles of number of triangles (26n + 4) right angles.
.. Sum of 3 angles of AOAB = 2 right angles.
.. Summation of the angles of n numbers of triangles = 2n right angles.
26 - n+ 4 right angles = 2n right angles.
or, 20 - n = (2n — 4) right angles.
2n—4
or, § = al right angles.
