Let ZX OA is an acute angle. We take a point P on

the side OA. We draw a perpendicular PM from P Pi A

to OX. As a result, a right-angled triangle POM is

formed. The three ratios of the sides PM, OM and Ls

OP of APOM do not depend on the position of the

point P on the side OA.

If we draw the perpendiculars PM and PM; from a
