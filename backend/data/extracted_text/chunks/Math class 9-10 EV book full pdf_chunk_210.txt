========================================

log, M” = rlog,M (proved)
Note: (log, M)" and rlog,M may not be equal.
For example, (log,4)” = (log,2%)° = 2° = 32, log, = 5-2 = 10 # 32
Formula 10 (change of base). log, M = log,M x log,b
Proof: Let, log, M = x, log,M =y
cat =M, b= M .
coat = or, (a®)v = (yy or, b=av §
