8.8.1 Plane Mirror
Simple mirrors are most commonly used in our daily lives. Ordinary mirrors are
used whenever a light ray travelling in one direction is to be redirected in another
direction. You must have noticed that in a plane mirror right and left side

mirror is to be reflected by a second mirror.
