Density of the salted water: p 1200 X 105m? 1.04 x 103 kg/m
Question: Density of Dead Sea water of Jordan is 1.24 kg/liter. What is the
volume of 1 kg water?
Answer: 1 liter is 1000 cc or 107m’
Therefore, density of Dead sea water,
_ kg  1.24kg 3 3
p=124 p= om = 124 X 10° kgm
Therefore, volume of 1 kg water:
v=" 1kg =0.81x 107° m®
TT 124x103 kgm? m
or 0.81 liter
Example: What is the density of the nucleus? What is the mass of 1 tea
spoonful of nucleus?
Nucleus consists of neutrons and protons. The mass of one of them is 1.67 x 10727 kg,
Their approximate radius is 1.25 fm = 1.25 x 1075 m . Therefore, if we can
calculate the density of neutron or proton, it can be considered as the density of
the nucleus!
