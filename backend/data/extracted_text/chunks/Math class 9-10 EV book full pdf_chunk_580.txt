Subtracting equation (4) from equation (3) we get,
(a1by — ashy) + baer — byez = 0
or, (ary — ashy)x = byez — bye
T 1
_—=—...(5
or byes — boc) arby — ashy ©)
Again, multiplying equation (1) by a, and equation (2) by a; we get,
ras + asbyy + craz = 0... (6)
razz + arbyy + coa1 = 0... (7)
Subtracting equation (7) from equation (6) we get,
(azby — arbe)y + craz — oa = 0
or, —(a1by — ashy = —(craz — c2a1)
y 1
or, ———— = ———_..(8
Cray — cya; Arby — ashy ®)
From (5) and (8) we get,
xT _ y _ 1
bey —bacy crap — ca; aby — ashy
From such relation between x and y, the technique of finding their values is called
the method of cross- multiplication.
From the above relation between x and y we get,
x 1 byca — bacy
