Describing People

A Read the following extract taken from Ernest Hemingway's story, The
Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber:

Francis Macomber was very tall, very well built if you did not mind that
length of hone, dark, his hair cropped like an oarsman, rather
thin-lipped, and was considered handsome. He was dressed in the same
sort of safari clothes that Wilson wore except that his were new. He was
thirty-five years old, kept himself very fit.

Notice that the details in the above passage describe the physical
features and appearance of Francis Macomber.
