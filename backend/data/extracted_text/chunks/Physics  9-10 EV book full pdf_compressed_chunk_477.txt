========================================

If we get the idea of temperature perfectly, we have to know its unit in
addition to, the important question of how we will measure the temperature. The
conventional unit of temperature is Celsius (°C), generally it is said that on this
scale at one atmospheric pressure and at the temperature at which ice melts is
called 0°C and at the temperature at which water boils is assumed to be 100°C.
But it is interesting to know that when scientist Celsius introduced this scale of
temperature, he assumed the temperature of boiling water as zero degree and the
temperature of fusion of ice as 100 degree; opposite to the present scale!
Although we use the Celsius scale of temperature in our daily lives, its
international unit is Kelvin (K). Adding 273.15°C with the reading of Celsius
