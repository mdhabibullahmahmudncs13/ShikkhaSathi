========================================

1) Let the base be 2. Express the area of the triangle in terms of x.

2) Find the length of the base.

3) If the length of the base of the triangle is 12 cm., find the area of the

equilateral triangle having the same perimeter as its perimeters.

Area of Quadrilateral Region

1. Area of Rectangular Region: Let, the length
of AB = a, breadth BC' = b and diagonal AC =
d of rectangle ABCD. We know, the diagonal p c
of a rectangle divides the rectangle into two equal rn
triangular regions. EEE a b
Area of the rectangle ABCD = 2x area of AABC [iiss

1 sy a
=2xza: b=ab Cdn nnnnnnn
perimeter of the rectangular region, s = 2(a +b) and A a B
observe that triangle ABC' is right-angled.

LAC? = AB? + BC? or, d% = a + 1? 4
cod=va? +b? o
