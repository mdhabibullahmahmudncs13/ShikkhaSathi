Q. In practical, this distance is measured by previously determined unit.
According to postulate 5(c) one to one correspondence can be established
between the set of points in every straight line and the set of real numbers. In
this connection, it is admitted that,
Postulate 7: One-to-one correspondence can be established between the set of
points in a straight line and the set of real numbers such that, for any points P,Q,
PQ = |a — b| where, the one-to-one correspondence associates points P and Q
to real numbers a and b respectively.
If the correspondence stated in this postulate is made, the line is said to have been
reduced to a number line. If P corresponds to a in the number line, P is called
the graph point of P and a the coordinates of P. To convert a straight line into
