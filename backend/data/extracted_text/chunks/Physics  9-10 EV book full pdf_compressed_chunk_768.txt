========================================

you can better understand what occurs in these situations. When you encounter a
high potential and touch it, a charge will flow from that higher potential to your
body, as your body's potential is lower. The amount of charge that flows depends
on various factors within your own body.
The potential of the object you touch can be either positive or negative. In one
scenario, electrons may leave your body, while in another, they may enter
it—Dboth scenarios represent electric current, just in opposite directions.
It's crucial to recognize that charge flows due to the difference in potentia not the
value of the potential itself. For example, a crow perched on a high-voltage elec-
tric wire does not suffer an electric shock because its potential matches that of
