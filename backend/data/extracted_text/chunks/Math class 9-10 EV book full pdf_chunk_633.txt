========================================

Let the first term of an arithmetic series be a and the common difference be d.
Then the terms of the series are:

First term =a =a + (1 —1)d

Second term =a +d =a+ (2 —1)d

Third term = a +2d =a + (3 —1)d

Fourth term =a +3d = a+ (4 —1)d

sonth term = a+ (n—1)d

This nth term is called common term of arithmetic series. If the first term of =
an arithmetic series in a and common difference is d are known, all the terms of &

the series can be determined successively by putting n = 1,2,3,4,--- in the nth
term.

Let the first term of an arithmetic series be 3 and the common difference be 2.
Then nth term of the series is = 3+ (n—1) x 2 = 2n + 1.
