========================================

obtained due to position, shape and motion of the object is called mechanical
energy. There are two forms of mechanical energy; these are kinetic energy and
potential energy.
4.3.1 Kinetic Energy
‘We have discussed earlier that the ability to do work is energy. Everyone of us
knows that when an object is in motion, it can push another object and set it into
motion resulting in the object moving a certain distance due to the pushing.
. Making another object move means, definitely a force has been applied there
d and traversing a distance due to this force means work is done there!
