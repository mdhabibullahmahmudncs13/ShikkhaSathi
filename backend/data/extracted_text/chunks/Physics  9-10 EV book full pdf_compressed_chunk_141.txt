and final velocities.
The examples of motion we see around us, such as the motion of a car, train or a
bicycle etc. have their accelerations as non-uniform almost all the time. For
example, if a car starts its motion from rest and increases its velocity gradually,
then starting from zero its acceleration reaches a particular value. When the car
attains its peak velocity, then its velocity does not increase any further and
3 theacceleration becomes zero again. If the car reduces its velocity and ceases it
