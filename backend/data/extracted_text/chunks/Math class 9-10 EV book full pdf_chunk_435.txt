========================================

angle]
So the line segment OA is perpendicular to AP. Therefore, the line segment AP
is a tangent at A to the circle with centre at O. Similarly, the line segment BP is
also a tangent to the circle.
Nota Bene: Two and only two tangents can be drawn to a circle from an external
point.
Construction 9. To draw a circle circumscribing a given triangle.
Let ABC be a triangle. It is required to draw a
circle circumscribing it. That is, a circle which passes 4
through the three vertices A, B and C' of the triangle
is to be drawn. M
Drawing:
1. EM and FN, the perpendicular bisectors of AB
and AC respectively are drawn. Let the line
segments intersect each other at O. B c
2. A 0 are joined. With O as centre and radius
equal to OA, a circle is drawn.
