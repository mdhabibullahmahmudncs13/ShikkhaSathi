Conditionals 173
How to make first conditionals?
First conditionals follow this pattern
If +subject + present tense followed by subject + future tense (will/may/might
+ verb) + extension (if needed)
Some conditions
There will be two parts in a first conditional sentence,
Fisrt conditional can be used in affirmative, negative, and question sentences.
If the if clause comes first, there should be a comma (,) where the if clause
ends.
Use of 1% conditional
1. We use 1% conditional to speak about a future possibility depending on
the present situation, the if-part is the present condition, and the part
with will/may/might is the future possibility.
2. We can use the first conditionals when we talk about possibilities
immediately after the present.
