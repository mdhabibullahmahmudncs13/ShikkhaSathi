Figure 3.01 : Position-Time and Velocity- Time graph
object is moving with a uniform velocity. Therefore, there is no change in
velocity. Therefore, from time 7, to #, no force is applied on the body. At the
instant #,, a force is applied on the stationary object to make it move with a
uniform velocity. Again just at the instant #,, by applying a force the motion is
stopped. No force is applied elsewhere.
Therefore, when 0 <t<t;, t; <t<t;and t, < t there is no force.
Only when, 7 =¢, and t = t, force is applied for a moment.
(ii) In the second graph, the object is in uniform motion; from 0 to #, and from
t, to the end, therefore no force is applied on the body during these time
