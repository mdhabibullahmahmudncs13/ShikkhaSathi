Force 77
Otherwise we can say that if we see an object in motion and can calculate its
acceleration, then if its mass is known, it is possible to calculate the force acting
on it.
Now we look at some examples.
0) Example
Question: A force of 100 N is applied on a stationary body of mass 5 kg for 10
s. (a) what will be the acceleration due to this force? (b) What is the velocity
after 10 s? (c) What is the velocity after 20 s? (d) What is distance travelled in
20 s? (e) show velocity and distance travelled by drawing a graph.
Answer: (a) acceleration,
_F_10N_
a=—== wg m/s
(b) velocity after 10's,
v=u+at=0+ 20 x10m/s =200m/s
(c) force is applied up to 10 s, since force is applied no more, therefore, after
