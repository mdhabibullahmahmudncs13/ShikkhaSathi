or, V4a? — 3600 = 80
or, 4a? — 3600 = 6400 [by squaring]
or, 4a? = 10000
or, a? = 2500
soa =50
The length of equal sides of the triangle is 50 cm.
Example 6. From a certain place two roads run in two directions making an
angle of 120°. From that place, persons move in the two directions with speed of
10 km per hour and 8 km per hour respectively. What will be the direct distance
between them after 5 hours ?
Solution: Let two persons start from A with velocities 10 km/hour and 8 km/hour
respectively and reach B and C' after 5 hours. Then after 5 hours, the direct
distance between them is BC. From C perpendicular CD is drawn on BA
produced.
AB =5x10 km = 50 km, AC = 5 x 8 kin = 40 km
and ZBAC = 120° [S
SL ZDAC = 180° — 120° = 60°
