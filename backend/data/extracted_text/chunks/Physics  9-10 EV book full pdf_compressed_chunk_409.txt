========================================

the river water it was half immersed, how much of it will immerse in the sea?
(Density of sea water, 25 = 1.03 x 10%kg/m?)
Answer: Density of river water Ay = 10° kg/m?
If volume of wood is Vand density is # then mass of wood will be Vp
. . . 1
In river water the wood is half immersed Vp = 3 Voy,
1 3 3
therefore, P=5Py = 0.5 x 10° kg/m’
Ifitis immersed by V; amount in the sea water,
Vp = Vip;
Vi p  05x10%kg/m?
—=—=—""""_-%x100 = 48.59
Vp; 1.03 x10%kg/m? x %
