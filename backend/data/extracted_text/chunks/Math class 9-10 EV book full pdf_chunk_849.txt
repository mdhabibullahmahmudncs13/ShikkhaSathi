We have also learnt if the numbers of data are n and n is an odd number, the
1
median will be the value of me th term. But if n is an even number, the median
will be numerical mean of the value of 3 and 6 + 1) th terms. Here we present
through example how mean is determined with or without the help formulae.
Example 10. The frequency distribution table of 51 students is placed below.
Find the median.
Fght(on)
Treaeney [4 [0 [12 [16 | 5] 5 |
Solution: Cumulative frequency distribution table for finding mean is as follows
Fagen)
Traueney | 4] 0] 12 16] 8] 3]
Frequency
Here, n = 51 is an odd number.
. 51+1
.. Median = the value of — th term = the value of26th term = 165
Required median 165 cm.
