electrons; flow of electricity is done by electron, negatively charged electrons!
Insulator: The substance which has no free electron for conducting electricity is
called an insulator. Plastic, rubber, wood, glass are examples of insulators.
Mainly, non-metals are insulators.
Semiconductor: There are some substances whose conductivity lies between
insulators and conductors at normal temperature, but their conductivity
increases with the rise of temperature. These types of substances are called
semiconductors. Silicon or germanium examples of semiconductors.
Semiconductor are elaborately discussed in the last chapter of this book.
11.1.3 Direction of electric flow
We have seen that if two bodies of different potentials are connected by a
