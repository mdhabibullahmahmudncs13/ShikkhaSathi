========================================

Once the user enters some input, the program resumes. For example, if we write
the following:
test_input=input ()
So. the test input variable will receive an input from us. However, no matter
what type of data number, letter, etc. the input() function accepts as input within
the program, it will receive it as a string (sir) data type. Now, let's take an input
into a variable and print it.
test input= input()
print{test_input)
prini(type(test_input)) 8
