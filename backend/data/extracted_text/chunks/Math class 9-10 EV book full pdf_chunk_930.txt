========================================

[Equality of sides]

2. Since /B=/E, side BA will coincide with side ED, and since Z/C=/F,

side CA will coincide with side FD. [Equality of angles]

3. Since BA and CA have common point A and ED and FD have common

point D, AABC will coincide with ADEF.

.. AABC = ADEF (Proved).

Theorem 11 (Hypotenuse-Side Theorem):

If the hypotenuses of two right triangles are equal and one side of one triangle

is equal to the corresponding side of the other triangle, then the two triangles

are congruent.

Special Nomination: Suppose in AABC and ADEF, the hypotenuse AC=DF

and AB=DE. We need to prove that AABC = ADEF.

Proof:

1. Place AABC on ADEF such that point B coincides with point E, side BA

coincides with side ED, and point C falls on the opposite side of F with respect
