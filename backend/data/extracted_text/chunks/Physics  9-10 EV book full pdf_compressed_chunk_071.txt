========================================

inch-foot is familiar still now (USA is an example!) inch is marked very often
on the other side of a meter scale. One inch equals 2.54 cm.
We can measure up to the smallest division on a scale. A meter scale is generally
divided up to millimeter, so using a meter scale we can measure the length of
anything up to millimeter. Therefore, if we say the length of anything is 0.364 m,
this means the length of this is 36 centimeter and 4 millimeter. Using a meter
scale it is not possible to measure lengths smaller than this - that is, generally we
can never say the length of a body is 0.3643 m. But from time to time, for
microscopic purposes we have to measure the smallest length of objects of this
type, which can be performed by using an interesting scale called vernier scale.
