========================================

a bowler throws a cricket ball towards the batsman, then the batsman can direct
the ball totally in a different direction by hitting the ball with his bat.
In the three examples given above, we see that velocity is changed by the
application of force on an object for a short or a long time. In the previous
chapter we have seen that the rate of change of velocity is acceleration.
Therefore we can say, when force is applied on an object, acceleration is
produced. The relation between the force applied on a body and the acceleration
is Newton's second law.
Newton’s second law: The rate of change of momentum of a body is
proportional to the applied force acting on it and the change of
momentum also takes place in the direction in which the force acts.
