========================================

After you send your e-mail, you might not receive an answer for a number of
reasons.

In many cases, important e-mails are sometimes bypassed because the receiver
simply looks at the subject and decides that it is not worth reading, or puts the
e-mail aside for later reading (which may, or may not, happen!). This can be a
problem if the information within the e-mail is essential.

To avoid e-mails being bypassed or deleted just follow the five key points. You
will get the attention of the receiver.
