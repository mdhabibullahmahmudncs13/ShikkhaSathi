========================================

ON
time, the length of OP is equal to the length of ON and the value of cos 0 = oP
is 1 approximately.
The angle, 0° is introduced for the convenience of discussion in trigonometry, and
the edge line and the original line of the angle 0° are supposed the same ray.
Therefore, in line with the prior discussion, it is said that, cos 0° = 1, sin 0° = 0

If 6 is the acute angle, we see tan) = —— cot = ——,

We define the angle 0° in probable cases so that, those relations exists.

Since division by 0 is not allowed, cosec 0° cot 0° can not be defined. S
