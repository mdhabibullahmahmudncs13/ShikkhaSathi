11.2.4 Equivalent Resistance: Series Circuit
If there is more than one resistance in a circuit, we will see how these resistances
can be considered as a single equivalent
resistance. In figure 11.11 there are two A By 3
resistances in the circuit, as C is connected to
the ground so it’s potential is zero and
the potential of A is V. We don’t know the V 1 Ra
potential of B, but we know that the same
amount of electric current I flows through R
and R,. = c
To keep it simple, we can say, the sum of two =
resistances is the total resistance R and the i a1 )
