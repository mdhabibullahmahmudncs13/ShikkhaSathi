2.6 Acceleration and Deceleration or Retardation
‘When an object moves with uniform velocity it has no acceleration. If there is a
change of velocity, then there is an acceleration. More clearly, we can say, the
rate of change of velocity with time is acceleration.
Since velocity has both magnitude and direction, the change of velocity can
occur in two ways. In our previous example, when you rode (your bicycle along
the curved path, the change of velocity occured at every tum and you ars
accelerated. Although you travelled the whole path with uniform speed,
acceleration took place due to change of direction only. If you tied a stone with
a string, as in the previous example, and rotated it over your head with uniform
