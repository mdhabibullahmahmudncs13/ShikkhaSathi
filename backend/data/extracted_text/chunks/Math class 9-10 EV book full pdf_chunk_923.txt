========================================

Similarly, the ray OD intersects line AB at point O. Hence, ZAOD + ZBOD = 1
straight angle = 2 right angle. [Theorem 1]
So, ZAOC + ZAOD = ZAOD + ZBOD
Therefore, ZAOC=/BOD [Subtracting ZAOD from both sides]
Similarly, it can be shown that ZCOB = ZAOD [Proved]
Theorem 6 (SAS Theorem):
If in two triangles, two sides of one are respectively equal to two sides of the
other, and the included angles are equal, then the two triangles are congruent.
Special Nomination: Suppose B E
in AABC and ADEF, AB =
DE, AC = DF, and the AN AN
included angle ZBAC = the A CD F
included angle ZEDF. We
need to prove that ZABC = ZDEF. g
