========================================

wire or pin through the cross (x) mark and fold the wire by pressing it.
Now rotate the circular paper below and see through the cut portion,
clearly you will see how longitudinal waves advance.
7.2.3 Wave related quantities
The quantities we have talked about in simple harmonic motion, actually all of
them can be used in case of waves. In a wave complete oscillation occurs, it has
a time period, frequency and amplitude. We have seen that when a wave
propagates, if we look at a particular particle of a medium, we will see that the
particle is executing simple harmonic oscillation!
In case of wave we can talk about two new quantities, one of them is the
wavelength. Wavelength is the distance from any phase of the wave to the next
