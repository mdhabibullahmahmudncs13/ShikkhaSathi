Quadratic Equations in One Variable

Equations of the form az? + bx + ¢ = 0 [where, a,b,c are constants and a # 0)

are called the quadratic equation in one variable. Left hand side of a quadratic

equation is a polynomial of second degree, right hand side is generally taken to
be zero.

x is the variable in the equation and highest 12 sq em %

power of x is 2. Such equation is a quadratic Xx cm

equation. The equation, which has the highest

degree 2 of the variable, is called the quadratic

equation.
