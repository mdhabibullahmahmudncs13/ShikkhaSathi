========================================

any interior angle at the centre of a circle produced
by any arc is proportional to the arc.

3. Area of circular region and circular segment
The area, surrounded by any circle, is called a circular region and the circle is
called the boundary of the circular region.
Circular segment: The area formed by an arc and the radius that joins the
end points of that arc to the centre of the circle is called circular segment.
If A and B are two points on a circle with centre O,
interior to ZAOB, radius OA and OB, and the arc
AB, form a circular segment. In previous class, we
have learnt that if the radius of a circle is r, the area
=r.
We know, any angle produced by an arc at the centre A r
of a circle is proportional to the arc.
