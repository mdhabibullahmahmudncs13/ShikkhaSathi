In the figure, two straight lines AB and C'D are cut by a straight line EF at P
and Q. The straight line EF is a traversal of AB and C'D. The traversal has
made eight angles Z1, £2, /3, Z4, /5, Z6, Z7, Z8 with the lines AB and CD.
Among the angles

1) Z1 and £5, £2 and £6, £3 and £7, Z4 and £8 are corresponding angles.

2) /3 and £6, Z4 and Z5 are alternate angles.

3) Z4, Z6 are interior angles on the right.

4) £3, £5 are interior angles on the left.
