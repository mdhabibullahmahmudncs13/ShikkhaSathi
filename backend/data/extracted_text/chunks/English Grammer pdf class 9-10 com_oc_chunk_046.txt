20 English Grammar and Composition
OR
Subject + verb + object + reflexive pronoun (as in After we had
completed our exams, we organized a party ourselves.)
We use reflexive pronouns immediately after the verb to talk about actions
or experiences that only affect the subject and none else.
Don’t touch the rod. You'll hurt yourself. (It'll hurt none but you.)
We use reflexive pronouns to mean that the activity has been done by no
other person than the subject.
She made the ice cream herself. (Nobody else made it.)
We use "each other’ to mean that the same action has been done by both
the persons.
Joyita and Jalal love each other. (Jayita loves Jalal and Jalal loves Jayita.)
