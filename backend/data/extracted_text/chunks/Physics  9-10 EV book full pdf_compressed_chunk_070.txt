Physical Quantities and Their Measurements 19
1.6 Measuring Instruments
Once it was very difficult to measure different quantities of physics accurately.
The job has become much easier due to electronics based instruments. For the
physics that we will try to learn in this book, knowing how to measure distance,
mass, time, temperature, electric current and voltage will be enough. Let us
discuss what type of instruments we will use to measure these:
1.6.1 Scale or Ruler
A Meter scale is used to measure small lengths and definitely you may have seen
it. Since this is 100 cm or I m long, it is called a meter scale. Since in many places
inch-foot is familiar still now (USA is an example!) inch is marked very often
on the other side of a meter scale. One inch equals 2.54 cm.
