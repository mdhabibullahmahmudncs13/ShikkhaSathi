Dear John
Writing from my home. I'm in Bangladesh, finally. It's late December. The
weather is fantasticl It’s not at all humid. The temperature is moderate - in
between 26-28 degree. Unlike England there is no rain, no strong wind here.
Usually we have strong sun but now the sunlight
is very soothing. In fact, our winter begins from November and continues till
February. January is the coldest month in Bangladesh. The most interesting
feature of winter Bangladesh is — the country is full of interesting vegetables
and delicious pitha, a kind of handmade cakes. Many foreigners like
Bangladeshi winter as it is milder than the winter in many parts of the world
