========================================

Wind energy: After solar energy, wind energy has occupied an important place
very quickly. In our country we are not familiar seeing large turbines for wind
energy, but in many countries of Europe this is a very familiar scene. The place
at which the wind mill is set up, a large tower is erected upwards, so there is no
waste of land at all, for this reason the environmentalists like it very much. From
a wind turbine it is possible to get a few megawatts of electricity! The utility of
the energy that is generated by using air; is increasing by 30% every year. This
number is not a small number at all.
