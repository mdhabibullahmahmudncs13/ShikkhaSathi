Magnetic Effects of Current 337
If current flows through the wire (from bottom to up) that current will create a
circular magnetic field around it and thus rearrange the magnetic lines of force,
by combining with the magnetic field that goes from the north pole to the south
pole. At the bottom of the wire the lines of forces will be more and at the top of
the wire the lines of forces will be less, which will push the wire in upward
direction.
If the direction of current through the wire is reversed, then the direction of the
circular magnetic field will also be reversed. Then the density of the lines of
force at the top of the wire will be more and hence push the wire downward.
