The Children are making electromagnet in the largest practical class of the world arranged
in Kuliarchar.
All of us were charmed at one point of our life when observing the attraction or
repulsion of magnet. Though magnetism and electric current seems to be
completely different topics, these are two different forms of the same energy, that
will be discussed in this chapter. We will see that as electric current can produce
a magnetic field, similarly a varying magnetic field can also produce an electric
current.
