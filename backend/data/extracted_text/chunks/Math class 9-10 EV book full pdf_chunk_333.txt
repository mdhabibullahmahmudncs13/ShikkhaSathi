Theorem 9. (ASA criterion)
If two angles and the included side of a triangle are equal to two corresponding
angles and the included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.
Let, in AABC and ADEF, /B = /E, ZC = A »
ZF and the side BC' = the corresponding side
EF. Then the triangles are congruent, i.e: ZN
ANABC = ADEF ’ cr r
Theorem 10. (Hypotenuse-side criterion)
If the hypotenuse and one side of a right-angled triangle are respectively equal
to the hypotenuse and one side of another right-angled triangle, the triangles are
congruent.
Let AABC and ADEF be two right angled 4 b
triangles, in which the hypotenuse AC =
hypotenuse DF and AB = DE. Then, AABC =
ADER B [a F
There is a relation between the sides and angles of a triangle. This relation is
