other. In this case also the graph is a straight Y
line.

‘We observe in the graph, though each of the given equations has separately
infinite number of solutions, they have no common solution as system of
simultaneous equations. Further, we observe that the graphs of the two
equations are straight lines parallel to each other. That is, the lines will never
intersect each other. Therefore, there will be no common point of the lines. In
this case we say, such system of equations has no solution. We know, such
system of equations is inconsistent and independent of each other.
