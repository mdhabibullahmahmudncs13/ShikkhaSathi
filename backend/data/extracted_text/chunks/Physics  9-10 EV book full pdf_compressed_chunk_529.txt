Question : A piece of iron of mass 10 gm heated at temperature 120 °C is dropped

into a container of water of mass 1 kg at temperature 30 °C. What will be the

temperature of water?

Answer:

Mass of iron my; = 0.01 kg

Mass of water m, = 1kg

Specific heat of irons; = 0.45 x 10° Jkg'K™

Specific heat of water 5, = 4.2 x 103 Jkg'K?!

The amount of heat given up by the piece of iron is equal to the heat gained by the

water. So, the temperature of iron T will be

TO mys, mys, 0.01 x 0.45 x 103 + 1 x 4.2 x 103
