Figure 3.10: Force is acting on a mass by two
Answer: weights from two sides using pulley.
Here, three objects are connected by two strings, resulting in the same
acceleration for all of them. The 10 kg mass will move downward, and the mass
m will move to the left, and the 5 kg mass will move upward. Let's denote the
acceleration as a.Two tension forces will act along the two strings: T_1
(connected to the 5 kg mass) and T_2 (connected to the 10 kg mass).
By applying Newton's laws of motion in the vertical direction for the 5 kg mass,
we get:
T1-5g=5a
For the 5 kg mass, T_1 acts upward. Using Newton's second law horizontally for
the mass m, we obtain:
“T2+T1=m(-a)
