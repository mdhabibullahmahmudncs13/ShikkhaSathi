Circle
A circle is a geometrical figure in a plane whose points are equidistant from a
fixed point. The fixed point is the centre of the circle. The closed path traced by
a point that keeps it distance from the fixed centre is a circle. The distance from
the centre is the radius of the circle.
Let, O be a fixed point in a plane and r be a fixed
measurement. The set of points which are at a ¢
distance 7 from O is the circle with centre O and IN)
radius 7. In the figure, O is the centre of the circle n B
and A, B and C' are three points on the circle. Each
of OA, OB and OC is a radius of the circle.
Some coplanar points are called concylcic if a circle passes through these points,
