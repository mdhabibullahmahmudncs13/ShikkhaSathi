Example 34. For a function of Annual Sports, members of an association
made a budget of Tk. 45000 and decided that every member would subscribe
equally. But 5 members refused to subscribe. As a result, amount of subscription
of each member increased by Tk. 15 per head. How many members were in the
association?
Solution: Let the number of members of the association be 2 and amount of
subscription per head be Tk. ¢.
Then total amount of subscription, Tk A = gx = 45,000 .
Actually numbers of members were (z — 5) and amount of subscription per head
became Tk. (gq + 15) .
Then, total amount of subscription (x — 5)(g + 15)
By the question,

qr = (zr =5)(¢ +15) + (1)

qr = 45000 +++ (2)
From equation (1) we get,

gz = (¢ — 5)(q + 15)
