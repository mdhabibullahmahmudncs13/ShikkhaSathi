10.2 Static Electricity by Friction
If a glass rod is rubbed by a piece of silk, (Figure 10.02) electrons start to move
from the glass to the silk. So the glass rod is positively charged and the silk
negatively. This happens because silk has more affinity for electrons than the
glass. Again if a plastic is rubbed using a flannel ( or wool), electrons will move
to plastic from the flannel. Because plastic has more affinity for electrons than
the flannel.
