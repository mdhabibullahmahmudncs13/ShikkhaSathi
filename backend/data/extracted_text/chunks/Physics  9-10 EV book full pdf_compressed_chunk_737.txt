========================================

materials electrons can make

movement very easily within the

materials. We call these materials

electric conductors. Again, there are some materials within which there are no
electrons that can move freely, in these materials electrons are tightly bound.
These are called nonconductors. Metals like gold, silver, copper etc. are good
conductors of electricity. Wood, plastic, glass, rubber etc. are nonconductors of
electricity.

If we have understood the topics explained so far about the structure of atoms,
the next topics following static electricity will be very easy to understand.
