========================================

This is the Modulo operator. Using this operator, you can divide the
variable on the left side by the variable on the right side to get the
remainder.
Practical Problem # 1: Let's create a program to take two numbers as input
and print their sum.
Solution: The program to take two integers as input and print their sum is given
below-
numi = int(input(‘Insert the first integer:'))
num?2 = int(input('Insert the second integer:'))
result = num l+num?2
print('The sum of, num], 'and’. num?2, "is". result)
‘When you run the above program, you can input any two numbers of your choice,
and then it will calculate the sum of those numbers, displaying the result as shown
below.
Insert the first integer: 50
Insert the second integer: 100
The sum of 50 and 100 is 150
