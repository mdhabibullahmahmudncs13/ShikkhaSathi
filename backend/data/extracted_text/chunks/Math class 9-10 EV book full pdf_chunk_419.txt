Chapter 8. Circle 177
In figure (i) the circle and the straight line PQ have no common point; in figure
(ii) the line PQ is a secant, since it intersects the circle at two points A and B
and in figure (iii) the line PQ has touched the circle at A. PQ is a tangent to the
circle and A is the point of contact of the tangent.
Remarks: All the points between two points of intersection of every secant of
the circle lie interior of the circle.
Common tangent
If a straight line is a tangent to two circles, it is
called a common tangent to the two circles. In the
adjoining figures, AB is a common tangent to both
the circles. In figure (a) and (b), the points of contact < r
are different. In figure (c) and (d), the points of (a)
contact are the same.
