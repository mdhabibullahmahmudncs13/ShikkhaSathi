========================================

Keeping the fundamental characteristics of the motions unchanged, the

activities of different motions can be changed as necessary. For example,

the instructions may be given to demonstrate two different motions at the
same time. In case of linear and oscillatory motion the participant have to
run straight by oscillating his or her hands left and right.

Discussion: Write down some addtional names of different motions

which can be demonstrated.

Investigation 2.03

To determine the speed of moving vehicles.

Objective: Determination of speed of different kinds of vehicles by
measuring the distances travelled at different times.

Apparatus: Ruler.

Working Procedure:
