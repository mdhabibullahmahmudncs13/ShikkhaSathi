========================================

13. ZA = 1 right angle of the triangle ABC. D is a point on AC. Prove that
BC? + AD? = BD? + AC”.

14. ABC is an isosceles right triangle. BC' is its hypotenuse and P is any point
on BC. Prove that PB? + PC? = 2PA%

15. ZC is an obtuse angle of AABC; AD is perpendicular to BC. Show that
AB? = AC? + BC* + 2BC - CD.

16. ZC is an acute angle of AABC; AD is perpendicular to BC. Show that
AB* = AC? + BC* —2BC' - CD.

17. QD is a median of the APQR.

1) Draw a proportional figure according to the stem.
2) Prove that, PQ* + QR? = 2(PD* + QD?)
3) If PQ = QR = PR, then prove that, 4QD? = 3PQ?
