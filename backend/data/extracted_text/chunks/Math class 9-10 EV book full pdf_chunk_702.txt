Rotational symmetry
When an object rotates around any fixed point, its shape and size do not change.
But the different parts of the object change their position. If the new position
of the object after rotation becomes identical to the original position, we say the
object has a rotational symmetry. The wheels of a bicycle, ceiling fan, square etc.
are examples of objects having rotational symmetry. As a result of rotation the
blades of the fan looks exactly the same as the original position more than once.
The blades of a fan may rotate in the clockwise direction or in the anticlockwise
direction. The wheels of a bicycle may rotate in the clockwise direction or in the
