is an isosceles triangle.
2. Prove that if two lines intersect a few parallel lines, the matching sides are
proportional.
3. Prove that the diagonals of a trapezium are divided in the same ratio at
their point of intersection.
4. Prove that the line segment joining the mid points of oblique sides of a
trapezium and two parallel sides are parallel.
