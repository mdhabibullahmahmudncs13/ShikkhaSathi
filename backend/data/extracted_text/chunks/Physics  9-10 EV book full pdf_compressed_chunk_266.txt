3.9.1 Types of Friction
Friction is divided into three types. These are, static friction, kinetic friction,
and rolling friction.
Static friction: The frictional force that develops when two objects are at rest
relative to each other is called static friction. Due to static friction we can walk,
our legs or shoe soles rub against the ground and we don’t slip.
Kinetic friction: The frictional force that is create when an object is in motion
relative to another object is called kinetic friction. When anyone grips the brake
