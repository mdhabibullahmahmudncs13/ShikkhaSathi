11.1.3 Direction of electric flow
We have seen that if two bodies of different potentials are connected by a
conductor, charge starts flowing and it continues until the potentials become
equal and we say electric current is flowing. Many of you may have started
thinking because when we talked about equalizing two different potentials by
flow of charge, we said that it is true for negative charges, as only negatively
charged electrons can go from one place to another. Then what happens in case
of positive charge? As the positive ions are strongly bounded in their own
positions, how does positive charge move from one place to another?
You may have already realized what happens in that case. The deficiency of
electron is positive charge. So increasing the deficiency by moving electrons
