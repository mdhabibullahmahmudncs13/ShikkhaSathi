========================================

To keep it simple, we can say, the sum of two =
resistances is the total resistance R and the i a1 )
current will be = V/(R ), but let us prove this igure 11.11: Two resistances

rather than writing it. circuit
Let us assume the potential at point B is V, ’
then for the first resistance R, we can write:
V-=V

Again we can write for the second resistance R;:
