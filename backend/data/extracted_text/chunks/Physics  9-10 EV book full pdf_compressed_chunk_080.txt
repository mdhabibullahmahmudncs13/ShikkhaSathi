1.6.2 Balance
Mass cannot be measured directly, so mass is
generally determined by measuring the weight.
‘When we say the weight of an object is 1 gm or 1
kg, then actually we mean that the mass of the WIE I
object is 1 gm or 1 kg. In earlier times to measure - 2%
the mass of an object, a balance was used, there h— —c/
the mass of the object was compared with the E tl
definite mass of a known weight. Now-a-days the Er
use of electronic balance (figure 1.08) has
increased a lot. If we keep the body on the Figure 1.08: Digital weigh
balance then the sensors of the balance can machine
determine the weight very precisely.

% Stop watches are used to measure time interval
Fp . r (figure 1.09). Once accurate stop watches were
