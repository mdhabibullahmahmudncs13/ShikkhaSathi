========================================

one pointy metal needle is set up on the roof. This current is then transferred to
the ground by some heavy conducting wires. The science behind this is very
simple. We have seen earlier that when a charged object is brought near an
uncharged body, the uncharged body becomes induced by opposite charge. So
while the possibility of a thunderbolt occurs, the pointy needles become
positively charged and an intense electric field is created due to pointy needles.
The surrounding air and water vapors become ionized due to this electric field
and these rises above and neutralizes the negative charges of clouds and reduces
the possibility of being a thunderbolt. When thunder needles are kept on the roof
of a tall building they often absorb the thunderbolt and the bar carries the huge
