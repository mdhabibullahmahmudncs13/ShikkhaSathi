Now, putting = = 1, —1 we see that the value of f(z) is not zero.
But, putting = = 2 we see that the value of f(z) is not zero.
Hence, f(2) =2°—2-6=8-2-6=0
Therefore, x — 2 is a factor of f(x).
cS fl@)=2-72-6
=a — 222 + 222 — 4x +37 — 6
=a%(v—2) + 2x(x — 2) + 3(z — 2)
=(z—2)(a® + 2x +3)
Example 31. Resolve into factors: z* — 3zy? + 25° and 2? + zy — 2¢°.
Solution: Here, consider = a variable and y a constant.
‘We consider the given expression a polynomial of x.
Let, f(z) = 2® — 3zy® + 24°
Then, f(y) =y* = 3y-y> +2" = 3 = 3y° =0
oo (x —y) is a factor of f(z).
Now, 2% — 3zy® + 2°
=a% — 2%y + 2%y — xy? — 22y® + 29°
=z —y) +ay(r —y) — 2° —y)
=(r—y)(a® + zy — 2%)
Again let, g(z) = 2? + zy — 2y*
gw) =v + = 27 =0
oo (x —y) is a factor of g(x).
