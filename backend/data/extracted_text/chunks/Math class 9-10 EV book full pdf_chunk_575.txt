========================================

3x —2y=5...(2)
From equation (1), y = 8 — 2x... (3)
Putting the value of y from equation (3) in equation (2) we get,
3x —2(8—2x)=5
or, 3x — 16 +42 =5
or, Tx =5+ 16
or, Tx = 21
or, x =3
Putting the value of z in equation (3) we get,
y=8-2x3
or,y=8—06
or, y =2
solution (x,y) = (3,2)
Substitution method: Conveniently from any of the two equations, value of
one variable is expressed in terms of the other variable and putting the obtained
value in the other equation, we get an equation in one variable. Solving
this equation, value of the variable can be found. This value can be put in any
of the equations. But, if it is put in the equation in which one variable has been
expressed in terms of the other variable, the solution will be easier. From this
