Frequency Polygon: The diagram drawn by joining frequency
indicated points opposite to the class interval of indiscrete data by line
segments successively is frequency polygon.
Example 4. Draw polygon of the following frequency distribution table.
Frequency | 8 | 10 | 15 | @ | 5 | a | 15 | 7
Solution: Histogram of frequency distribution is drawn taking each square of
graph paper as 10 units of class interval along with z-axis and each square of
graph paper as 5 units of frequency along with y-axis. The mid-points of the
sides opposite to the base of rectangle of histogram are identified which are the
