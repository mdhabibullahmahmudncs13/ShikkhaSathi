========================================

Example 18. If f(z) = 2? — 4x + 3, then determine f(—1).

Solution: Given, f(z) = 2? — 4x +3
f(D) = (12 —4(-1)+3=1+4+3=8

Example 19. If g(x) = 2% + a2? — 3x —6 then for what value of a will bel g(—2) = 0?
Solution: Given, g(r) = 2* + aa? — 3x — 6
59-2) = (=2)* + a(-2)* = 3(-2) - 6
=-8+4a+6—-6=4a—8

As per question g(—2) =0

cda—8=0orda=8ora=2
if a = 2,then g(—2) = 0.

Domain and Range

For ordered pairs of any relation the set of first elements is said to be domain
and the set of second elements is said to be range.

Let R be a relation from set A to the set B, that is, R C A x B. For the ordered
pairs of R the set of first elements will be the domain of R and the set of second
elements will be called range of R. The domain of R is denoted by Dom R and
