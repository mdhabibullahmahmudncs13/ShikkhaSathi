Formula 1. (a+b)? = a® + 2ab + b*
Formula 2. (a —b)? =a — 2ab + b*
Remarks: It is seen from Formula 1 and Formula 2 that, adding 2ab or —2ab to
a® +b, we get a perfect square, i.e. we get (a +b)? or (a — b)?. Substituting —b
instead of b in Formula 1 we get Formula 2 : {a + (=b)}* = a® + 2a(—b) + (=b)?
That is, (a — b)? = a* — 2ab + b*
Corollary 1. a? +b” = (a +b)? — 2ab
Corollary 2. a? +b? = (a — b)? + 2ab
Corollary 3. (a+ b)* = (a —b)? + dab
Proof: (a+b)? = a®+ 2ab+ b> = a® — 2ab + b* + dab = (a — b)* + 4ab [I
Corollary 4. (a — 1b)? = (a+b)? — 4ab
Proof: (a —b)? =a — 2ab+ b> = a’ + 2ab+ b> — dab = (a + b)* — dab [I
b)? —b)?
Corollary 5. a+b? = fab faz tr
Proof: From Formula 1 and Formula 2,
