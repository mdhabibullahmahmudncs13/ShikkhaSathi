========================================

work. But in physics, neither the person nor the machine does the work, always
the force applied does the work. This force may be applied by a person or a
machine.
Let us assume that, you have pushed an object to a distance s by applying a force
F and left it after setting it in motion. The object has travelled an additional
distance d and at last it has stopped. How much work is done?
The amount of work done is W=Fs, as no force was applied while traversing the
distance d, so no work is done.
