Theorem 29. If a line segment divides the two sides or their produced sections
of a triangle proportionally, it is parallel to the third side.
Special Nomination: In the triangle n A
ABC the line segment DE divides the
two sides AB and AC or their produced
sections proportionally. That is, AD : D E
DB = AE : EC. It is required to prove B ¢
that DE and BC are parallel. B CD E
Drawing: Join B, E and C', D.
Proof:
AADE AD
Step 1. ABDE DB [Triangles with equal height]
ANADE AE
and ADEC ~ BC [Triangles with equal height]
AD AE
Step 2. But DB EC [Given]
ANADE  AADE . .
Step 3. Therefore, ABDE — ADEC [ from (i) and (ii)]
ABDE = ADEC

Step 4. But ABDE and ADEC are on the same side of the common base DE.

So they lie between a pair of parallel lines.
