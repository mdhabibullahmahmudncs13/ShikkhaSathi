========================================

AB and C'D are parallel and equal.
Similarly, AD and BC are parallel and equal.
Therefore, ABCD is a parallelogram with diagonals
1 1
AC = AO+0C = Fate =a
and BD = BO+0D = high = band the angle included between the diagonals
is ZAOB = Zax.
Therefore, ABCD is the required parallelogram.
Construction 5. Two diagonals and a side of a parallelogram are given.
Construct the parallelogram.
. Let a and b be the diagonals and ¢ be a side of the parallelogram. The
g parallelogram is to be constructed.
