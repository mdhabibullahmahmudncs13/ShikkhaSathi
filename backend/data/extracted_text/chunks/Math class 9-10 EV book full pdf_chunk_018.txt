========================================

Basic characteristics of addition and multiplication processes of real
numbers :
1. If a and b are real numbers, (i) a + b is a real number and (ii) ab isa real
number.
2. If a and b are real numbers, (i) a +b =0b+ a and (ii) ab = ba
3. Ifa, b, care real numbers, (i) (a+b) +c = a+ (b+c) and (ii) (ab)c = a(bc)
4. If a is real number, there are only two real numbers 0 and 1 such that
(i) 0#1, (ii) a+0=0+a=caand(iii)a-1=1-a=a IS
