========================================

(ii) The rays which are parallel with the principle axis, (Figure 9.20 XP) will
(PS) appear to diverge from the focal point (F) after refraction.
(iii) If the direction of the light ray is reversed then it goes back through
the way it came. Therefore, if any ray goes (Figure 9.20, SP) towards
the focus then it will be refracted in parallel with the principle axis.
Now we can find out how the image of an object will be in a concave lens.
Suppose an object XY is kept near a concave lens. (Figure 9.20) To make the
analysis easy, we have taken the point Y of that object on the principle axis YR.
To find where the image of a point will be formed, at least two rays should be
drawn from that point. But we can find the image of Y without drawing two rays.
