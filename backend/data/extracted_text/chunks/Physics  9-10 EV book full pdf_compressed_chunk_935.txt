========================================

radioactivity. The time in which half of the nucleus disintegrates (or radiates) is

known as half life. Therefore, the more the radioactivity of an element, the less

its half life is. The half life of a stable nucleus having no radioactivity can be

considered to be “infinity”.

It is necessary to know that radioactivity is a nuclear phenomenon, so a nucleus

is transformed into another through radioactive emission. A different nucleus

can accept or donate one or two electrons from the surroundings to become a

charge less atom. This is because the energy of the electrons of an atom is much

smaller than the nuclear energy of a nucleus.

Example

Question: The half life of a radioactive element of 1 kg is 100 years. What will be

its mass after 200 years?
