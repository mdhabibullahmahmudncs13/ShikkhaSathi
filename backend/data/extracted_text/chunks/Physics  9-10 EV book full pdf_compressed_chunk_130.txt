speed. To understand the internal relationship between speed and velocity, some
examples discussed:
To explain distance and displacement we considered a curved path in figure 2.04
and showed different positions in that path. To have an understanding about
speed and velocity, we can consider the same example. But now we have to tell
how much time you have taken for going from one position to another. Suppose
you have taken 20 minutes for coming from position A to B by cycle. Then your
average speed will be:
Average speed = distance travelled/time
Therefore, __ tm 4x1000m_
