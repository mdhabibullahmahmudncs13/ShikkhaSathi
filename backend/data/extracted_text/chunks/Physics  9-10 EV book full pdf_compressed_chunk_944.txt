communication using Morse code and then through the use of vocal
communication by telephone (Figure 13.03). During the first and second world
war, different types of specialized vacuum tubes were used in controlling weap-
ons, radar, navigation etc. In 1946 the first computer ENIAC was invented using

13.2.2 Transistor
In 1947 the Transistor was first invented in Bell Laboratory and for this
invention John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley were awarded
the Nobel Prize. No one could imagine at that time how fast and widely the
transistor would change the whole world.
A transistor can work just like a vacuum tube, but compared with a vacuum tube
