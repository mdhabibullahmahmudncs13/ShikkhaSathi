Example 21. Resolve into factors: 92% — 30xy + 25>
Solution: 922 — 30zy + 25¢>

= (37)% — 2 x 37 x 5y + (5y)°

= (3x — 5y)* = (3x — 5y) (3x — 5y)
Difference of two squares: Expressing an expression as the difference of two
squares and then applying the formula a? — b* = (a + b)(a — b).
Example 22. Resolve into factors: a — 1+ 2b — b?.
Solution: a —1+2b—b? =a” — (b* — 20+ 1)

=a (b=1 = {a+ (b-DHe— 6-1)

=(a+b—-1)(a—b+1)
Example 23. Resolve into factors: a® + 645"
Solution: a’ + 64b" = (a?)? + (80%)?

= (a?)? +2 x a® x 8b” + (8b*)? — 16a%’

= (a? + 8b%)? — (dab)?

= (a + 8b” + dab) (a® + 8b* — 4ab)

= (a® + dab + 8b*)(a® — dab + 8b?)
