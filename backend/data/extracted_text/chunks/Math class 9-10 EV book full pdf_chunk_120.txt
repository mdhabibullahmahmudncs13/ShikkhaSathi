Algebraic Expressions
Meaningful organization of operational signs and numerical letter symbols is
called Algebraic Expressions. Such as, 2a + 3b — 4c is an algebraic expression.
In algebraic expression, different types of information are expressed through the
letters a, b, ¢, p, q, r, m, n, x, y, z, ... etc. These alphabet are used to solve
a different types of problems related to algebraic expressions. In arithmetic, only
Q i; . .
S positive numbers are used, where as, in algebra, both positive and negative
