The velocity of light in a vacuum is 2.99792458 x10* ms’. If light enters a
medium, its velocity decreases from this. To explain this process a quantity named
refractive index is defined. You can easily show that light changes its direction due to
the change of its velocity while passing from one medium to another. Due to this
property of light, or refraction, a wonderful event may happen named total
internal reflection. We will discuss various uses of total internal reflection in this
chapter.
Convex and Concave lens can be made by using refraction. Which type of
images can be formed using these two lens will be discussed in this chapter. PS
