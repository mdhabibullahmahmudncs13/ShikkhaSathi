Current Electricity 301
11.1 Electric current
We have discussed in the previous chapter that if two bodies have a
potential difference, then charge flows from the body of higher potential to
the body of lower potential. The flow of charges continues until the
potential becomes equal. This flow of charge is the flow of current or
electricity, which we generally call “electricity”. Using this electricity,
lights turn on, the fan rotates, and the phone charges!

11.1.1 Electromotive Force and Potential Difference
You can understand that electricity flows only if there is a potential
difference. If we want to get a continuous flow of electricity, we have to
