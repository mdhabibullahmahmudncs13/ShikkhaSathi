Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 23
examples are the set of first 10 odd natural numbers, set of integers, set of real
numbers ete. Sets are usually denoted by the capital letters of English alphabet
like A,B,C,... X,Y, Z.
For example, the set of three numbers 2,4, 6 can be denoted by A = {2,4,6}
Each object or member of the set is called its element. For example, if B = {a,b},
to express that a and b are its elements the sign € is used to express the element.
a and b are elements of B;
.a € Band we can read as a, is a member of B (a belongs to B)
b € Bis a member of b, (b belongs to B)
The above set B does not contain ¢. So it is expressed as ¢ ¢ B and is read as ¢
is not a member of B (¢ does not belong to B)
