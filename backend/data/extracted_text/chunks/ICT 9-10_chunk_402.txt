========================================

data in a variable, then it will be boolean data. Only two information can be
stored in bool data type: True or False. One such example is:
a=True
Python programme has other datatypes besides int, float, str and bool; we will
know about them if ever needed while writing a programme. The data we store
in the variable is stored in the computer's memory. So, when we use the variable
somewhere in the programme, the value of the variable stored in the computer
memory will be used.
Change of Data Type: Type Casting
The data type of a variable can be easily determined using type(). If we print a
variable inside the type() function. we will get the datatype of that variable.
For example. if we run the following programme:
test variable= 73.07
print (test variable)
print(type(test_variable))
