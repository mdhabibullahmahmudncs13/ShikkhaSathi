oh = 43.301 (approx.).
.-. Height of the tower is 43.30 metre (approx.)
Example 2. The height of a tree is 105 metre. If the angle of elevation of the
tree at a point from its foot on the ground is 60°, find the distance of the point
on the ground from the foot of the tree.
Solution:
Let, the distance of the point on the ground from the A
foot of tree is BC" = x metre. Height of the tree
AB = 105 metre and at C' the angle of elevation of
the vertex of tree is ZACB = 60°, From right-angle AABC' we. 105m
