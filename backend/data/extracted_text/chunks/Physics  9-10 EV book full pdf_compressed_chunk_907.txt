For your understanding, a rectangular core is shown. Practical transformers are
constructed a bit differently, the secondary coil is winded on the primary coil
and the core is also slightly different.
If the number of turns in the primary coil is n, and that of the secondary coil is
n, if AC voltage V, is applied in the primary coil, then the AC voltage V that
will be found in the secondary coil depends on number of turns.

If I, current flows through the primary coil, then the current /, flowing in the
secondary coilis found from conservation of electrical power.
