========================================

If a® = N,(a > 0, a # 1), then z = log, N is defined as a based log, N
Note: If a > 0,then a” is always positive whatever may be the values of x,
positive or negative. So, only the log of positive numbers has values that are real;
log of zero or negative numbers have no real value.
‘Work: Express the following values in exponents in terms of log:

Let,a>0,a#1 b>0,b#1land M >0, N >0
Formula 6 (zero and one log). Ifa >0, a# 11) log,1 =0 2) log,a=1
Proof: We know from the formula of exponents, a’ = 1
.. from the definition of log, we get, log,1 = 0 (proved)
