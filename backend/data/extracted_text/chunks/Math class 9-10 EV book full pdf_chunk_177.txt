.. Compound principal is Tk 17865.24
.-. Compound profit is Tk. (17865.24 — 15000) Tk. = 2865.24.
‘Work:
1) The loss is 50% when 10 lemons are sold 50 taka. What will be the
profit or lossif 6 lemons are sold 50 taka?
2) What will be the profit of principal of Tk. 750 in 4 years at simple
1
interest 65 percent per annum?
3) Find the compound interest of Tk. 2000 in 3 years at compound interest
of Tk. 4 percent per annum.
Example 42. The loss is 2% when 10 sticks of ice creams are sold per taka. How
many sticks of ice creams are to be sold per taka to make the profit of 2%?
Solution: If the cost price is Tk. 100, the selling price at the loss of 2% is Tk.
