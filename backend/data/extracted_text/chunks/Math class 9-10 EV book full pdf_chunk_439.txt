========================================

is drawn. Then, this circle is the required inscribed
circle.
Proof: From O, OF and OF are drawn perpendiculars respectively to AC" and
AB. Let these two perpendiculars intersect the respective sides at E and F'.
The point O lies on the bisector of ZABC.
SOF =0D
Similarly, as O lies on bisector of ZACB, OE = OD
0D =0FE=0F
- Hence, the circle drawn with centre as O and OD as radius passes through D,
a
Sand F.
