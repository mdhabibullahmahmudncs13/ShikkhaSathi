100 Physics
4.1 Work
We use the term ‘work’ in various ways in our daily life. A gatekeeper
guarding a house all day long, sitting on a tool, may claim to have done a lot of
work, but in the words of physics that is not any work. In terms of physics the
word ‘work’ is well defined. If a force F is applied on any object and the object
traverses a distance s during the application of force (that is displacement
occurs) then, the amount of work # done by the force is:
W=Fs

Unit of work: J (Joule)
