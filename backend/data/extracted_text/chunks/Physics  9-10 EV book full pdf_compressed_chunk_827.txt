If the temperature of a conductor is raised, its resistance increases, but the case
is the opposite for a semiconductor. The resistance decreases if the temperature
goes up in a semiconductor. The reason is, there are free electrons in a conductor
for the flow of current, but a semiconductor does not have free electrons. If the
temperature is raised, some electrons are found for the flow of current, so a
temperature rise causes the decrease of resistance of a semiconductor.
