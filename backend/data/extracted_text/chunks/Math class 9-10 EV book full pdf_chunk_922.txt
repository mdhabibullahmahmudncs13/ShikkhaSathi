.. Area of the entire faces of the given solid.
=2(75x6+6x4+7.5x4)sq. cm
=2(45 +24 +30) sq. cm
=2x99 sq. cm
=198 sq. cm
Proof of the required theorem
Theorem 2:
If two straight lines intersect, the opposite angles formed are equal.
Special Nomination: Assume lines AB and CD intersect
at point O. As a result, angles ZAOC, ZCOB, ZBOD A D
and ZAOD are formed at O.
We need to prove that ZAOC is equal to the opposite 0
Z/BOD and ZCOB is equal to the opposite ZAOD. B
Proof:
The ray OA intersects line CD at point O.
Therefore, ZAOC + ZAOD = 1 straight angle = 2 right angle. [Theorem 1]
Similarly, the ray OD intersects line AB at point O. Hence, ZAOD + ZBOD = 1
straight angle = 2 right angle. [Theorem 1]
So, ZAOC + ZAOD = ZAOD + ZBOD
