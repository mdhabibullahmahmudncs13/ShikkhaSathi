Therefore, you see amazingly that if the magnitude of (4,/4)) is 100 then you
will get 100 times more force on the second cylinder than the force you
applied on the first cylinder!
This process is very effective and used to control very large factories and
aircrafts. But keep in mind; it is the principle of increasing forces. In this
process energy cannot be increased atl. You will ge t back the same amount
of energy on the second cylinder that you have applied on the first cylinder.
