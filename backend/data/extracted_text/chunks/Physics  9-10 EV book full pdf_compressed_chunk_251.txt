========================================

Newton’s Third Law: When an object applies a force on another object,
then that object also applies a force of equal magnitude on the first object
but in the opposite direction.
In physics, generally Newton's third law is written as, “Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction”, although we have not written it in this form. By this time
since we have a little idea about force, confusion may occur if force is termed as
“action” or “reaction” “suddenly”. Moreover, those who are the new learners of
physics, their first question will be if every reaction (a force) has an opposite
reaction (another force) then why action and reaction are not cancelling each
other, producing zero? For this reason, the third law will have to be written very
