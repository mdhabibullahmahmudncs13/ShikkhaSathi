========================================

right-angled triangle, the circumcentre lies on the hypotenuse of the triangle.
Construction 10. To draw a circle inscribed in a triangle.
Let AABC be a triangle. It is required to draw am
inscribed circle. that is, to inscribe a circle in it or to
draw a circle in it such that it touches each A
of the three sides BC, CA and AB of AABC. JAN E
Drawing: BL and C'M, the bisectors respectively F, Lo;
of the angles ZABC and ZACB are drawn. Let Vi ON
the line segments intersect at O. OD is drawn AdbaxN
perpendicular to BC' from O and let it intersect BC'  B C
at D. With O as centre and OD as radius, a circle
is drawn. Then, this circle is the required inscribed
circle.
Proof: From O, OF and OF are drawn perpendiculars respectively to AC" and
