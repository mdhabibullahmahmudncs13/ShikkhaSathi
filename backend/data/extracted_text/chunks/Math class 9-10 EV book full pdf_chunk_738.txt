========================================

Similarly, area of AABC'
1. 1
= be sind = 50a sinB
3. Three sides of a triangle are given:
Let in AABC, BC' =a, CA =D and A
AB =c.
.. Perimeter of the triangle 2s = a + b+ c. © b
We draw AD L BC.
Let, BD = x, then CD =a— x B D C
In right-angled AABD and AACD «a —>
AD? = AB? — BD? and AD? = AC? — CD?
AB? — BD? = AC? — CD?
or, ?—1*=b — (a — x)?
or,  — 1? =b — a® + 2ax — 1?
or, 2ar = c* +a — 1?
