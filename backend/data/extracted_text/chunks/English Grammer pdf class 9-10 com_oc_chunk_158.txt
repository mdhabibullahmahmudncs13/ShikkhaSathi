========================================

but now | cannot.
We use cannot/can’t to express prohibition: You cannot bring mobile phones
into the classroom, and you cannot chew gums in my class.
For permission and requests:
We use can/could to give or ask for permission. Can is less formal than could.
Can | borrow your pen? Oh, sure!
Could | use your laptop, please? You could take it to your room, if you like.
