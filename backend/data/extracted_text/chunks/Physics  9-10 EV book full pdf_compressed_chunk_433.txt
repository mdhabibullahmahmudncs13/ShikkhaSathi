========================================

density of air decreases, the air pressure also decreases. So, it is possible to
predict about the local weather seeing the air pressure on a barometer. If the
barometer shows high pressure then it is understood that the air is dry and the
weather is good. If the pressure starts to decrease then it is understood that the
quantity of vapor is increasing. If pressure low then air from the nearby areas
will come quickly and storm and rain will start.
5.5 Elasticity
All of you must have, one time or another, elongated a spring or a rubber band
by pulling on it and then releasing it. You have certainly noticed that after
releasing the spring or the rubber band it regains its previous length. In physics,
pulling is termed as ‘applying force’ and the change of the length is termed as
