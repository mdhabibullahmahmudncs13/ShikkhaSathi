========================================

no acceleration of the mass m in the vertical direction.
Two forces are acting on the second mass: the gravitational force Mg acting
downward and the tension force T (the same tension T acting on each part of the
same string) acting upward. Since the tension force acts along the string and
away from the object, we can apply Newton's second law to find:
T-Mg =M (-a)
Here, a negative sign is placed before the acceleration because the acceleration
of the mass M is directed downward, and since both objects are connected by the
string, the magnitude of the acceleration of mass M is also a. By solving the two
equations above, we find that a=Mg/(M+m)
Using this acceleration we can explain the motion of the object located on the
table.
