========================================

extent a measusement is accurate . The reliability of a result will be increased if
we can inform how accurate the result is when we publish the result of an
experiment. You can report the measurement of the accuracy of your
experiment if you know some conventional rules for finding the accuracy of an
experiment.
Suppose, you are measuring the length of an object by a scale. How accurately
you will measure the length of the object depends on how finely your scale is
graduated. If the scale is graduated in 1 cm intervals then you will express your
result for length in some definite number of cm. But the real length of the object
is not exactly equal to this mentioned number of cm but perhaps very close to it,
so there is a possibility of uncertainty in your measured length. That is why, we
