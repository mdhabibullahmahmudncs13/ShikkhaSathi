========================================

This is due to reflection. Within the building the distance is not enough to
hear the sound separately. When we hear something the feeling persist for
around 0.1 s, so to hear two sounds separately, it needs separation of 0.1 s
differences between two sounds.Velocity of sound is 330 m/s, therefore to create
a difference of 0.1 s, sound has to travel at least 33 m.
If we stand in front of a big wall, a building, or a high hill at least half of this
distance (16.5 m), the sound will take 0.1 s to come back after being reflected
and we will hear the reflection of sound or echo. S
