========================================

of energy takes place not only between potential energy and kinetic energy. But
all the known forms of energies around us can transform from one form to another.
In our daily lives, the energy we see around us cannot be created or even can be
destroyed, it only changes from one form to another. This is the law of conservation
of energy.
4.5.2 Transformation of Energy
Around us we see many examples of transformation of energy, e.g.
(a) Electrical energy
If we want to give example of the transformation of energy, at first we give
examples of electrical energy. Because this energy can be transformed into
other energy very easily. Not only this, it is easiest to transmit electrical energy
from one place to another. Though around us there are many types of
