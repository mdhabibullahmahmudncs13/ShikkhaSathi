specified through particular enunciation. For this, necessary figure is to be
drawn.
Generally, in proving the geometric theorem the following steps should be
followed :
1. General enunciation.
2. Figure and particular enunciation.
3. Description of the necessary constructions and
4. Description of the logical steps of the proof.
If a proposition is proved directly from the conclusion of a theorem, it is called
a corollary of that theorem. Besides, proof of various propositions, proposals for
construction of different figures are considered. These are known as constructions.
By drawing figures related to problems, it is necessary to narrate the description
of construction and its logical truth.
