Refraction of light 245
In vacuum v = 3 x 10% ms /1.00 = 3 x 10° ms™*
In air v=3x10%ms"/1.00029 = 3 x 10% ms!
Inwater v=3x10°ms!/1.33 = 2.26 x 10° ms!
In normal glass v =3 x 10° ms™'/1.52 = 2x 10° ms!
In diamond v = 3 x 108 ms!/2.42 = 1.24 x 10° ms"
To determine the refractive index of a
medium is, the wavelength of light
for which the refractive index is
measured must be stated, because the first medium
refractive index depends on the 90° (]
wavelength of light.

What we need to understand the Boi
N . 1
laws of refraction are already known.
In the case of reflection of light we
have imagined a normal from the Figure 9.01 : Refraction of light from
point of incident. We do the same first medium to the second
