========================================

optical fiber by total internal
lass. The inner part of it is called the reflection.
core and the outer part is called clad . Although the two are made of same glass,
the refractive index of the inner part (core) is greater than that of the outer part.
For this reason light can be taken very long distances by trapping it in optical
fibers the through total internal reflections (Figure 9.10). Light can be taken
hundreds of kilometers through optical fibers, because the absorption of light in
optical fibers is very low. Absorption would have been greater if the visible light
was there so infrared rays of long wavelength are used in optical fibers. How
optical fibers are used in a process called endoscopy of medical science is
described in the last chapter.
