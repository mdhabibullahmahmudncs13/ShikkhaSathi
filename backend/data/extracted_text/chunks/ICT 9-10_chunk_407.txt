What will be the output of this program. then? Whatever you input will be print-
ed as the output. However, notice that even if you input an integer or a fraction,
its data type is printed as str. This means that any data you enter will be received
as a string by the input() function. But if you want the input to be stored not as a
string, but as an integer or a float data type, you'll need to convert the data to that
specific data type. By writing the program as shown below, when taking any
input, we can directly convert il lo the desired data type in the input() function-

test_input = ini{input(})
