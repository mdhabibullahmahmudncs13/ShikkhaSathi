========================================

m?and bottom area of your two legs is 0.03 m?. What pressures will you apply on
the floor when lying down and standing ?
Answer: Mass is 50 kg, therefore weight is: 50 x 9.8 N = 490 N
Pressure when lying down, p = A90N =980 N
0.5 m? m?
490 N N
Pressure when standing, P = ——— = 16, —

You see less pressure is applied when you are lying down. For this reason when
one falls in quicksand he has to lie down so that the applied pressure becomes
lower and he does not submerge quicksand.
Again the opposite is also true, if the area of force applied is less, then the
pressure increases. The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when
the sharp point of the nail is placed on a wood or wall and hammered on the flat
