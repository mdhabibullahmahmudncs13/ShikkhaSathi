========================================

there will be a paragraph of a befitting topic sentence followed by arguments/ideas to
support the topic sentence and a conclusion to summarise what has been told in the
topic sentence and the body. There cannot be any new ideas in the conclusion.
However, if there are 5 questions to answer, it does not mean that students will write
only five sentences. They will use sentences as per their discretion but the paragraph as
a whole answer the questions. If there are 10 marks for this item, learners should be
able to make at least 10 sentences. The word limit for classes 6-7 is 150 words, for class
8, itis 170 words, and for 9-10 it is 200 words at least. 10% plus minus can be accepted.
Keep an eye on the content rather than the mechanical calculation of sentences. Assess
