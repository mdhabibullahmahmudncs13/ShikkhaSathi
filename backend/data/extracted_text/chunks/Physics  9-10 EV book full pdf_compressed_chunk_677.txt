Figure 9.04: (a) Angle of incidence of light is 45° (b) Angle of
incidence is 60° and angle of refraction is 45°
Answer : We know n;siné, = n; sin 6,

9.1.3 Relative refractive index
We said that the refractive index of a medium is always greater than 1. Because
, as the refractive index of a medium is a comparison of the velocity of light in
that medium with the velocity of light in a vacuum, it will be greater than 1.
Sometimes the refractive index of a medium is expressed in comparison with
another medium. Then the refractive index may be less than 1 depending on
which medium is being compared with which.
