========================================

Therefore the power of a lens P Tp N ET
is inversely proportional to the
focal length. If the focal length =
is fin meters then unit of power
P is the diopter. If the power of Figure 9.27 : The lens which have as much as
the glass is 2.5 (Nobody uses alier the focal length , the object is seen to be
diopter in general conversation). ager
Then the focal length of this
glass will be
f= H = = m = 0.4m (the unit is in meter)
Power is not only used only for convex lens to show bigger objects. In the case of
concave lens the same power is used to show smaller images. In the concave lens in
which the object is seen as much as smaller, the power will be greater or the focal
length will be smaller. In the case of a convex lens the power is positive and in the
