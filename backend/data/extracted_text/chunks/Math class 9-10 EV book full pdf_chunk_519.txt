========================================

1. ifa:b=c:d, then b:a=d: c [Invertendo]
Proof: Given that,
a_c
bd
or, ad = be [multiplying both the sides by bd]
ad be .
or, — = — [dividing both the sides by ac where a and ¢ are non-zero)
ac ac
db
or, — = —
ca
iebra=d:c
2. Ifa:b=c:d, then, a:c=b:d [Alternendo|
Proof: Given that,
a _c
bd
or, ad = be [multiplying both the sides by bd]
db
or, = = = [ dividing both the sides by cd where ¢, d are non-zero)
IE I
ab
or, — = —
cd a
ie ,a:c=b:d BS
