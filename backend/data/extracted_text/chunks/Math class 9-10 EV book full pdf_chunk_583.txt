Example 4. Solve by the method of cross-multiplication:
6x —y=1
3x +2y =13
Solution:
ing the tions with
Making the right hand side of the comparing the equations wi
. LL. ax + by +c = 0 and
equations 0 (zero) by transposition, we
ot ax + bay + ca = 0
gh 6 1=0 respectively we get,
zr —y—1=
_ a; =6,bp=—1,¢ =—1
Sr+2y—13=0 ar =3,by=2 cy = 13
By the method of cross-multiplication we get,
xT _ y _ 1
bcs — baer raz —caar arb — ashy
or, * = Y = 1
T(x (—13)—2x (=1) (1) x3—(—13)x6 6x2—3x(—1)
x y 1
or, —— = —2 _ —
13+2 —3+78 1243
£3 y 1 * Y !
or, 15 = 75 = Is ap | by [&] ay by

Therefore, — = — or, z= — = 1 4
15 15 15 x y 1

solution (x,y) = (1,5)
