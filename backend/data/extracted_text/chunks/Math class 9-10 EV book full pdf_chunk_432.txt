========================================

point is located outside the circle, two tangents to the circle can be constructed.
Construction 7. To draw a tangent at any point of a circle.
Let A be a point of a circle whose centre is O. Tt is
required to draw a tangent to the circle at the point A.
Drawing: O, A are joined. At the point A, a
perpendicular AP is drawn to OA. Then AP is the
required tangent.
Proof: The line segment OA is the radius passing Pp
through A and AP is perpendicular to it. Hence AP A
