3.1 Inertia and Concept of Force- Newton’s First law of motion
In the previous chapter we have learned about velocity, speed, acceleration (and
deceleration), elapsed distance and their mutual relationships. We have deduced
the equations of motion and applied them to solve problems related to motion as
well. In this chapter we will learn how motion can be created or motion can be
influenced by applying force. We may begin with Newton’s First law.

Newton’s First law of motion: Newton’s first law of motion can be
