Effect of Heat on Matter 183
Boiling point changes due to pressuse. Boiling point decreases if pressure is low,
boiling point increases if pressure is high. This is why those who go to big heights
while mountain climbing, they have to cook something for a long time because due
to low pressure water starts to boil at
comparatively low temperatures. As
temperature can not be increased, so it takes
a longer time to cook. Pressure cookers a A <4 g
have been made for this reason. During Es a
cooking pressure is increased by confining F=f a

boiling point of water is increased so water [l
continues to boil at a high temperature. As |
the temperature is high, cooking will be |
done faster. -
