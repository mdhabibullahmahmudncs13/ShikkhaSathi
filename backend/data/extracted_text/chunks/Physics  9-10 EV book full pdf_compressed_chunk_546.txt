O) Example
Question : Hang a stone of mass 10 gm from a string 1 m long. What is its time
period? ; 1
Answer: T=2r|-=27|555s=20s
g 9.8
The time period remains the same whether the mass of the stone is 10 gm or not.
If you wish, by measuring the time period you can determine the value of g just
now. Try and see!
If a mass is attached to the lower end of a spring, the mass will extend the spring
and. This state of the spring is called the equilibrium condition (Figure 7.01-0).
Now we pull the mass downward by a short distance a and release it (Figure
7.01). Then the mass will moving upward, crossing the equilibrium condition, it
will move upward by a distance a. Then again it will be moving downward,
