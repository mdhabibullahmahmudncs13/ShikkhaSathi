A formal letter is a letter that you write in formal situations, such as, a student
writing to the Head Teacher/Principal of an educational institute for a
scholarship or the waiver of the fees; a person writing an application for a job,
or someone writing a letter to the editor of a newspaper; or any other kinds of
business letter, such as an order or a complaint letter, etc.
In formal letters, no contraction, idioms or phrasal verbs, no colloquial or
conversational style or tone is used. An objective, detached style is used in
formal writings. Features of informal style mentioned above are not used in
