Chapter 1. Real Numbers 3
V5 —
For example, v2 = 1.414213 .., 3 = 1.732. , 5 = 1.118... etc are irrational
numbers. No irrational number can be expressed as ratio of two integers.
Decimal Fractional Number: Rational and irrational numbers when expressed
using decimal sign are called decimal fractional number For example,
5 10
3 = 3.0, 3 = 2.5, 3 = 3.3333..., V3 = 1.732... etc are decimal fractional
numbers. If there are finite number of digits after decimal sign, then this is called
finite decimal fraction and if there are infinitely many digits, then it is called
infinite decimal fractions. For example, 0.52, 3.4152 etc are finite decimal
4
fractions, whereas 3= 1.333...,v/5 = 2.123512367...,etc are infinite decimal
