========================================

by higher amount by the application of an equal amount of force. But a body
with less mass can be displaced easily. Or otherwise we can say, if the mass is
increased then inertia is increased as well.
0) Example
Question: The two graphs illustrate the values of position and velocity with time
in figure 3.01, explain where and for what period force was applied?
Answer: Both the graphs are identical to look, but they contain totally different
information.
(i) In the first graph, from 0 to ¢, or from ¢, to the end, there is no change in
position in these two time intervals, this means there is no velocity, therefore
there is no question of change of velocity. This means definitely no force is
acting in these two time intervals. From time #, to £,, there is a change in position,
