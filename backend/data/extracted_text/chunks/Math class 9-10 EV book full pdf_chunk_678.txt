========================================

and the line segment AD from vertex A divides
the side BC' at D such that BD : DC = BA : n
AC. Tt is required to prove that AD bisects
ZBAC ie. ZBAD = LCAD
Drawing: Draw at C' the line segment CE
parallel to DA, so that it intersects the side BA i D re
produced at E.
Proof:
Step 1. For ABCE DA || CE [by construction]
BA: AE = BD: DC [theorem 28]
Step 2. But BD: DC = BA: AC [supposition]
S.BA: AE = BA: AC [from step 1 and step 2]
CAE = AC
Therefore, ZACE = LZAEC [base angles of isosceles triangle are equal]
Step 3. But ZAEC = ZBAD [ corresponding angles]
and ZACE = ZCAD [alternate angles]
Therefore, ZBAD = ZCAD [from step 2]
PS
EB .. the line segment AD bisects ZBAC
