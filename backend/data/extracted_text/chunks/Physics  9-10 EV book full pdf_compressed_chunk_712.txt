The distance less than Focal length
Imagine an object XY, which is kept between the lens and the focal point (Fig-
ure 9.23). By the same logic described before, we can say that the image of point
Y will be formed on YOF line. If a perpendicular is drawn from the image of X
on this axis, we’ll get the position of the image of Y.

Figure 9.23: A bigger image is seen in a convex lens if the object is placed within the
focal length.
Now let’s draw two rays from the point X. XC line, which is parallel with the
axis will go towards the direction of T through the focal point F. If a ray from
point X is drawn through the center point of the lens, it will go straight along XO
