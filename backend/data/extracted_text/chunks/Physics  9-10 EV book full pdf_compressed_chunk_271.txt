Though the wheel of the car rotates but due to less friction, the car or truck
cannot come out from the mud. The wheel slides. Then to rescue the car or truck,
the friction between the wheel and the mud is increased in an alternate way.
Tyre’s Surface: Because of the friction between the car’s tyre and the road the
car can move on the road. If this friction was not present, then the tyre of the
car would slip and the car would not be able to move forward. To increase this
friction many types of grooves are designed on the tyre (Figure 3.19). Those
who drive cars always give attention to whether the grooves of the car are
smooth or flat. If the grooves become flat, then after applying the brakes the car
will slip instead of stopping.
