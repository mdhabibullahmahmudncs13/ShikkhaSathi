garden.

Sox #40; x =5

.. the path is 5 metres wide

Example 14. Shahik bought some pens for Tk. 240. If he would get one more

pen in that money, average cost of each pen would be less by Tk. 1. How many

pens did he buy?

Solution: Let, shahik bought x pens in total for Tk. 240. Then each pen costs

240
Tk.—.
x
If he would get (z+ 1) pens by Tk. 240, then the cost of each pen would be Tk.
240
z+1
240 240
By th stion, —— = — —1
y the question, —== po
240 240 — x
or, —— =——
r+1 £2

or, 240z = (x + 1)(240 — x) [by cross-multiplication]

or, 240z = 240z + 240 — 2? — x

or, z% + x — 240 = 0 [by transposition]

or, x + 16x — 15x — 240 = 0

or, (x +16) — 15(x + 16) = 0

or, (x +16)(x — 15) = 0

cx+16=0,orz—15=0

fz+16=02=-16
fr—15=02=15

But the number of pen x cannot be negative.
