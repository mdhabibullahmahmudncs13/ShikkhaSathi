Drawing: Follow the steps below:
1. Draw a line segment PQ = 11 cm.
2. At P, construct an angle of ZQPL = 60° and at Q, an angle of ZPQM = 45°
on the same side of PQ.
3. Draw the bisectors PG and QH of the two angles. Let the bisectors PG
and QH of these angles intersect at A.
4. Draw perpendicular bisector of the segments PA, QA to intersect PQ at B
and C'.
5. Join A,B and A,C.
Then, AABC is the required triangle.
‘Work:
An adjacent side with the right angle and the difference of hypotenuse and
the other side of a right-angled triangle are given. Construct the triangle.
Example 2. Base of a triangle a = 3 cm., base adjacent acute angle 45° and
the sum of other two sides s = 6 cm.
