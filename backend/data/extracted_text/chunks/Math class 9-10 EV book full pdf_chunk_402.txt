========================================

points A and B of the circle divide the circle into two
arcs. The terminal points of both arcs are A and B
and there is no other common point of the two arcs
other than the terminal points.
Arc cut by an Angle
An angle is said to cut an arc of a circle if
1. each terminal point of the arc lies on the sides
of the angle,
2. cach side of the angle contains at least one A B
terminal point and P
3. Every interior point of the arc lies inside the
angle. The angle shown in the figure cuts the
APB arc of the circle with centre O.
