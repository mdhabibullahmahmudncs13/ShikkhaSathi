Density of a substance
Objective: Determine the density of a substance
Apparatus: Spring balance, a solid which can sink in water, water in a pot.
Theory: Dividing the mass of a body by its volume, density is measured.
Mass of the body can be measured by a spring balance. It is possible to
determine the volume of the body using the Archimedes law. After
immersion, the decrease of the mass in grams is the volume in cc (cm?).
Procedure: 1. Determine the mass of a body using a spring balance.
2. Tie the body with a thread and hang it from a spring balance
and determine the weight keeping the body inside the water.
3. Determine the density of the body.
