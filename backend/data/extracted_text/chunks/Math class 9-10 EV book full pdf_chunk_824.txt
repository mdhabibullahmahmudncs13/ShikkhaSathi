========================================

6° — 8°. The lowest range of the class is 6° and the highest range is 8°. The
frequency of this class is 11. Similarly, The limit of the second class is 9° — 11°
and the frequency of this class is 13. Now if the frequency 11 of first class is added
to the frequency 13 of the second class, we get 24. This 24 will be the cumulative
frequency of the second class and the cumulative frequency of first class as begins
with the class will be 11. Again, if the cumulative frequency 24 of the second
class is added to the frequency of the third class, we get 24 + 7 = 31 which is the pS
cumulative frequency of the third class. Thus cumulative frequency distribution &
