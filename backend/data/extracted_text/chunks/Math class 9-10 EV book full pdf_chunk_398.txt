the centre of the circle is the middle point of the hypotenuse.
4. A chord AB of one of the two concentric circles intersects the other circle
at points C' and D. Prove that, AC' = BD.
5. If two equal chords of a circle intersect each other, show that two segments
of one are equal to two segments of the other.
6. Show that, the two equal chords drawn from two ends of the diameter on
