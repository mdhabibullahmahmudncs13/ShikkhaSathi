========================================

in class VII and VIII. We have seen if the data under investigation are arranged

in order of values, the data cluster round near any central value. A gain if the
disorganized data are placed in frequency distribution table, the frequency is found
to be abundant in a middle class i.e. frequency is maximum in middle class. In
fact, the tendency of data to be clustered around the central value is number
and it represents the data. The central tendency is measured by this number.

Generally, the measurement of central tendency is of three types (1) Arithmetic

means (2) Median (3) Mode :

Arithmetic Mean: We know if the sum of data is divided by the numbers of the

data, we get the arithmetic mean. But this method is complex, time consuming
