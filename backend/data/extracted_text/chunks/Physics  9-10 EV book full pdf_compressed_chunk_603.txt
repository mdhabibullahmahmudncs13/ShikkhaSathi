========================================

refraction and absorption. (Figure first medium second medium

8.02)

While traversing from the first Figure 8.02: Reflection, refraction and

medium into the second medium, if absorption of light from one medium to

a part of light returns to the first another.

medium, the phenomenon is called reflection. Some parts of it may enter the

second medium which is called refraction and some of it may be absorbed which

is called absorption. In this chapter we will discuss reflection and in the next

chapter we will discuss refraction.

It has been said earlier that light is a wave. Generally a wave needs a medium to

travel, (If there is no water how will a wave be created in it). But this is different

in case of light. As this is a wave consisting of electric and magnetic fields, so
