========================================

E50 sme
a=—=10 m/s“ =0.5m/s
Your acceleration will be exactly towards left,
_F_ 50 1g 2
a=_=g;m/s = 1m/s
Therefore the stone and you will move in different directions. By pushing the
stone you cannot move it from one end to the other. Because a distance will be
created between you and the stone. So it is not possible to push the stone nonstop
for 10 s. But after the stone starts its movement, it will reach the other end
«ww moving by itself on the frictionless surface. You will also reach the opposite end
S but at an earlier time.
