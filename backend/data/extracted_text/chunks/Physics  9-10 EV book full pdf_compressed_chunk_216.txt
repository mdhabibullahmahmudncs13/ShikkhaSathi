Here we have only one equation and two a
unknown quantities v, and v,, therefore we TH
cannot calculate the values of v, and v,. We ms ¢ ( ) me
need another equation to determine the
values of v, and v,. Fortunately, we have ie ad
another equation too. In the next chapter, ms ¢ : $ jm:
when we will learn about energy, we will
get the second equation from the law of —$w
conservation of energy. This phenomenon . ( ) ©
is the law of conservation of energy. In the Hs
next chapter you will find that the kinetic

energy of an object can be expressed as /
PR . . v, are the new velocities of masses
3 mu, where m is the mass and u is the mand m, respectively
velocity of the object. We assume that no / ’
