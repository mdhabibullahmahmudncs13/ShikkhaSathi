been discussed. If we closely look at the steps of construction, we see that in some
cases it is possible to construct the quadrilaterals directly. In some cases, the
construction is done by constructions of triangles. Since a diagonal divides the
quadrilateral into two triangles, when one or two diagonals are included in data,
construction of quadrilaterals is possible through construction of triangle.
