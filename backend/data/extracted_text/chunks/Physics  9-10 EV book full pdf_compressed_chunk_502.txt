========================================

Real and Apparent Expansion
It has been said earlier that a liquid is always heated in a container. If heat is
applied, the expansion of the container occurrs along —
with the liquid. So the expansion of a container is kept ini Cc
in mind to measure the exact expansion of a liquid. Fl A
The expansion of a liquid, without considering the B B
expansion of the container, is called apparent
expansion. If the expansion of a liquid is measured
considering the expansion of the container, it is called
real expansion.
If a glass bulb with a long graduated stem is heated
liquid with filled up to mark 4, first we observe that
the upper level of the liquid comes down to mark B Figure 6.06 : Real and
(figure 6.06). It will happen because due to the apparent expansion.
