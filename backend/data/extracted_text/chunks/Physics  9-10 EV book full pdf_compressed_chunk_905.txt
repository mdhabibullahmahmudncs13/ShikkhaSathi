========================================

in a voltmeter. The transfer of electricity from one coil to another coil in this
process (directly, without any electrical connection) is called transformer.
We can do some amazing things with this transformer. If the number of turns of
both the coils is the same, then for a definite AC voltage applied in the left side
coil, we will get the same AC voltage in the right side coil. If the number of turns
on right side is ten times of that of the left side, then the voltage becomes ten
times. If the number of turns on the right side is ten times less, then the voltage
will be ten times less. The coil on the left side where AC voltage is applied is
called the primary coil and the right side coil (from where voltage is returned
