360 Physics
Usually the electrons are bound to the atoms in semiconductors. With the
increase of temperature, one or two electrons may become free. There are free
electrons in conductors so the semiconductors may act as conductors to some
extent. From to the view point of physics it is an interesting phenomenon, but
not very suitable for practical use. An interesting thing is done to make it more
useful. Atoms with five electrons in its outer most shell. e.g, phosphorous are
mixed with silicon crystal. Hence, the fifth electron of phosphorous becomes an
extra electron. It is not necessary for the extra electron to be bound to the
atoms of phosphorus. This electron behaves like free electrons by making the
