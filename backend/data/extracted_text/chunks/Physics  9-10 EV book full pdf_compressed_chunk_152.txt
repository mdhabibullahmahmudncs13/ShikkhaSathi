========================================

understood from the equation of falling bodies. This is because there is no mass of
object in the equations of velocity and traversed height. That is the acceleration
due to gravity acts equally on both heavy and light objects. So the freely falling
body traverses equal distances in the same time.
The second law of Galileo is the law of increase of velocity due to g. If the initial
velocity u is zero then velocity v is proportional to g. Galileo's third law is nothing
except the equation of 4. In this formula ifwe consider #=0 then we see that
traversed distance / is proportional to t2
