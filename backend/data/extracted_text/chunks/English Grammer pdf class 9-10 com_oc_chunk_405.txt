========================================

Note that when we change direct speech to indirect speech we do not

change word by word. We do some fine tuning to make the language lively.

Otherwise it becomes mechanical and unnatural. This is why in the above

indirect sentence it is written -

She confirmed that she would go as was free in the evening. We didn’t write

— She said that she would definitely come. She also said that she was free in

the evening.

This type of fine tuning is important far changing speech from direct to

indirect especially when you have a whale conversation to change.
