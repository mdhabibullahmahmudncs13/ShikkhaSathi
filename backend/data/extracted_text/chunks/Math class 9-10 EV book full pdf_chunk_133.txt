8. Ifa+b=+7anda—b=+/5, prove that, Sab(a® +b?) = 24
9. Ifa+b+c=9and ab+ bc + ca = 31, what is the value of a® + b> + ¢*?
10. If a® +b? + ¢* = 9 and ab + be + ca = 8, what is the value of (a +b +c)? ?
11. Ifa+b+c=6and a’ +b? + ¢* = 14, what is the value of (a — b)? + (b—
eo)? + (c—a)??
12. If x = 3, y = 4 and z = 5, what is the value of 92% + 16y* 4 42> — 24xy —
16yz + 12zx ?
13. Express (a + 2b)(3a + 2¢) as the difference of two squares.
14. Express 22 + 10x + 24 as the difference of two squares.
15. Ifa* +a? +b" = 8 and a® + ab+ b* = 4, find the value of, 1) a? +? 2) ab
Formulae of Cubes
Formula 6. (a+ b)* = a® + 3a’b + 3ab® + b° = a® + b° + 3ab(a + b)
Proof: (a+b)* = (a+ b)(a +b)?
= (a+ b)(a* + 2ab +b?)
= a(a® + 2ab + b*) + ba” + 2ab + b%)
