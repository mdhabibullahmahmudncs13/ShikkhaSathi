This means that gold or any other metal can be heated quickly but water cannot
be heated so easily.
6.6 Fundamental Principles of Calorimetry
In winter during a bath we often pour a little boiling water into a bucket of cold
water. The boiling water slowly become cold by giving up heat to the cold water.
The cold water of the bucket also slowly becomes hot by absorbing the heat
from the boiling water. Within a short time, all the water will get to a
comfortable temperature by decreasing the temperature of the boiling water and
increasing the temperature of the cold water. If we wish, we can find things like
the amount of heat lost or gained, and their final temperature when various
objects of various temperature are mixed together. To do so we just have to know
a few rules. They are:
