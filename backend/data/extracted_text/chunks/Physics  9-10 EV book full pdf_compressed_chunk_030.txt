Before the eighteenth century heat was considered a mass-less liquid. In 1768
Count Rumford showed that heat is a kind of energy and mechanical energy can
be converted into heat energy. Lord Kelvin, in 1850, introduced two important
laws of thermodynamics on the basis of the research work of many other
scientists.
An extensive research started on electricity and magnets at that time. In 1778
Coulomb invented the law of force between charges. Many kinds of research
were started after the invention of the electric battery by Volta in 1800. In 1820
Oersted showed that magnets can be made by the flow of electricity. In
