2) Cut AB = a from any ray AX. Draw
ZXAE = x at the point A. Take AD = D
s from AE. Join B, D. Now draw
ZDBC equal to ZADB at the point B. c
The line segment BC intersects AD af
the point C. . ABC is the required
triangle.
A a B x
3) Let the perimeter of the square p = 2s. We are to draw the square.

rid in the interior of ZBAD. The arcs
intersects each other at the point C'. Join
B,C and C, D. A B x
ABCD is the required square.
