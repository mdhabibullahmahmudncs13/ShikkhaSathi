1. From any ray BF cut the line segment BC' )
cqual to a. At B of the line segment BC "
draw an angle ZCBF = Zz. A
2. Cut a line segment BD equal to d from the b—
ray BE. n, (x
3. Join C,D and at C' make an angle ZDCA 5
equal to ZEDC on the side of DC" in which ‘ oF
EF lies.
Let the ray C'A intersect BE at A. Then, AABC' is the required triangle.
Proof: By construction, in AACD, ZACD = ZADC
SAD = AC
So, the difference of two sides, AB — AC'= AB — AD = BD =d
Now, in AABC', BC =a, AB — AC =d and ZABC = Zz
Therefore, AABC' s the required triangle.
‘Work:

1) If the given angle is not acute, the above construction is not possible.
‘Why ? Explore any way for the construction of the triangle under such
circumstances.
