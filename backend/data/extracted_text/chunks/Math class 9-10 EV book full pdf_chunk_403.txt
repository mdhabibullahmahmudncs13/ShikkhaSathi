Angle in a Circle (Inscribed angle)

If two chords of a circle meet at a point on the circle

then the angle formed between these chords is called

circular angle or angle inscribed in a circle.

In the figure, ZACB is an angle in a circle. Every c

angle in a circle cuts an arc of the circle. This arc

may be a major or minor arc or a semi-circle.

The angle in a circle cuts an arc of the circle and

the angle is said to be standing on the cut off arc. 8

The angle is also known as the angle inscribed in the A Pr

conjugate arc.

In the adjacent figure, the angle stands on the arc

APB and is inscribed in the conjugate arc ACB.

It is to be noted that, APB and ACB are mutually

conjugate.
