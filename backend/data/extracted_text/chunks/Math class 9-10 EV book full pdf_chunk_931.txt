========================================

coincides with side ED, and point C falls on the opposite side of F with respect

to DE. Assume G is the new position of point C.

2. Since AB=DE, point A will coincide with point D. As a result, ADEG
.. will be the new position of AABC, meaning DG=AC, ZG=/C, and
s /DEG=/B=1 right angle.
