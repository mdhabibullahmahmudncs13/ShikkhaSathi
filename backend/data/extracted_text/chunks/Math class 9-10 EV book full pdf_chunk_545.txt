========================================

Let length of the given land be 3z metres and breadth be 2y metres.
Therefore, the length of the other land is 4 metres and breadth is 3y metres.
.. the area of the given land is = 3x - 2y = 62y square metres and the area
of the other land is = 4x - 3y = 12zy square metres.
According to the given question, 6zy = 120000 or, zy = 20000 .. the area
of the other land is = 12zy = 12 x 20000 = 240000 square metres.
3) Let the length of the given land be 3x metres and the breadth be 2y metres.
Therefore, the length of its one diagonal is B22 + (29)? metres.
We get from the previous (b) problem, xy = 20000
According to the question, VB) + (29)? = 500
or, 92% + 4y* = 250000
or, (3x + 2y)? — 2 3x - 2y = 250000
or, (37 + 2y)? — 12zy = 250000
or, (3z + 2y)* — 12 x 20000 = 250000
