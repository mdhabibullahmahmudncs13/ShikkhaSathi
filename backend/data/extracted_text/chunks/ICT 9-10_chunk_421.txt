Practical Problem #5: Write a program to determine whether a given year is a
leap year or not.
Solution: To know if a year 1s a leap year, we need to divide the year number by
400. If the remainder is zero, il is a leap year. Otherwise, the year number has Lo
be divided by 100. If the remainder is zero, it is not a leap year. On the other
hand, if the remainder is not zero, then we need to divide the year number by 4
again. Tf the remainder is zero, then the year is a leap year; otherwise, it is not.
year - inc (input{'Enter the vear (4 Digit) to check :'1)
