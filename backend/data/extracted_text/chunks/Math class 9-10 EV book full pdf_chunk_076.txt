========================================

Observation: If order of elements in the set are changed or certain element is
repeated set is not changed.

Difference of Sets

Let A = {1,2,3,4,5} and B = {3,5}. If we delete the elements of set B from
that of A then we get {1,2,4} and is denoted by A\ B or A — B and is read A
delete B.

A-B={1,2345)}— {3,5} ={1,2.4}

Example 6. If P= {x:2 isa factor of 12 } and Q = {x : z is a multiple of 3 5
and xz < 12}, then determine P — Q. =
