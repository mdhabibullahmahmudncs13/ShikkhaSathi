========================================

harmonic motion the phase that develops at any instant, after one time period,
this phase returns again.
7.2 Waves
All of us have seen waves, when a stone is thrown into water then waves spread
out in all directions from that point. When a bulb is switched on in the room, the
light that spreads in the room is also a wave. When we talk, the sound that reach
from one place to another place is also a wave. When a compressed spring is
released, the deformation that propagates through it is a kind of a wave too. In
short, we can say, we can realize what a wave is. But what will we say if we want
to give a nice definition for it in terms of physics?
