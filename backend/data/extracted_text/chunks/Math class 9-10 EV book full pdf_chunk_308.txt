Angle
When two rays in a plane meet at a point, an angle
is formed. The rays are known as the sides of the
angle and the common point as vertex. In the figure, P
two rays OP and OQ make an angle ZPOQ at their
common point O. O is the vertex of the angle ZPOQ.
The set of all points lying in the plane on the @ side 5 2
of OP and P side of OQ is known as the interior
region of the ZPOQ. The set of all points not lying
in the interior region or on any side of the angle is
called exterior region of the angle.
