Logarithmic Methods
Logarithmic systems are of two kinds :

1) Natural Logarithm: Mathematician John Napier (1550-1617) of
Scotland published the first book on logarithms in 1614 by taking e as its
base. e is an irrational number, e = 2.71828... Such logarithms are called
Napierian logarithm or e¢ based logarithm or
natural logarithm. log, x is also written in the form Inz.

2) Common Logarithm: Mathematician Henry Briggs (1561-1630) of
England prepared a table of logarithm (log table) in 1624 with 10 as
the base. This logarithm is called Briggs logarithm or 10 based
logarithm or practical logarithm. This logarithm is written as log,,z.
