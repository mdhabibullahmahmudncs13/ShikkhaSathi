Although this equation looks like another general equation, there is some amazing
physics hidden in it, which we will reveal in the fourth chapter.

Example
Q J
Question: The velocity of a car is increased by 60 km/hour within 1 minute of
starting from rest. What is its acceleration?
Answer: From now we will use the unit of time in second (s) instead of minute
or hour and for distance meter (m) will be used instead of mile or kilometer.
The final velocity of the car is
— 60 km _ 60 x1000 M1667 /
Y= hour TT 60x 60s OME
So the problem is like this, a car attains a velocity of 16.67 m/s in 60 s starting
from rest, what is its acceleration?
v = at
v  16.67m/s
J = 2
a=; 505 0.278 m/s
Question: A car is moving with a velocity of 60 mile/hour, suddenly its engine
