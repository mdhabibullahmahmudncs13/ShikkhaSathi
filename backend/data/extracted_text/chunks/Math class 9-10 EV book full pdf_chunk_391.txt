Chord and diameter of a circle
The line segment connecting two different points of
a circle is a chord of the circle. If the chord passes
through the centre, it is known as diameter. That
is, any chord forwarding to the centre of the circle is B
diameter. In the figure, AB and AC" are two chords Cc
and O is the centre of the circle. The chord AC is
a diameter, since it passes through the centre. OA A
and OC are two radii of the circle. Therefore, the
centre of a circle is the midpoint of any diameter.
The length of a diameter is 2r, where r is the radius
of the circle.
Theorem 17. The line segment drawn from the centre of a circle to bisect a
chord other than diameter is perpendicular to the chord.
Let AB be a chord (other than diameter) of a circle C
