========================================

instruments like telescopes, the silver or x Hy x

aluminum layer is coated on the glass B

surface, so that the two images, one 4%

lighter and other 96% clear are not formed, Figure 8.08: The image of X
«rather it forms a 100% clear image. object will form in X" position.

age using geometry we need to draw
at least two rays. It will be easier to draw the picture if we consider XP (normal
to the plane) and XO as ray as shown in figure 8.09. Triangle OPX and OPX’ are
congruent. Therefore XP = X'P, which means the image has formed at a distance
equal to the distance of the object from the mirror.
