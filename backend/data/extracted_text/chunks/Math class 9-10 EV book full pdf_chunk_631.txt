Arithmetic Series

If the difference between any two adjacent terms of a series is always equal, it is
called arithmetic series.

Example 1. 1+3+5+ 749+ 11 is a series. The first term of the series is 1,
the second term is 3, the third term is 5 etc.

Here, second term — first term = 3 — 1 = 2,

third term —second term = 5 — 3 = 2, fourth term — third term = 7 — 5 = 2,
fifth term — fourth term = 9 — 7 = 5, sixth term — fifth term = 11 — 9 =2
Hence, the series is an arithmetic series.
