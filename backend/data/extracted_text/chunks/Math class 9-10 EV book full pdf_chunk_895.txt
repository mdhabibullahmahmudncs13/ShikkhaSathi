Solution : Denominator of the first fraction = a —4 = (a+ 2)(a—2)
Denominator of the second fraction
=a’ +3a-10 = a’ -2a+5a—-10
=a(a-2)+5a-2) = (a-2)(a+5)
L.C.M. of the two fractions = (a + 2)(a — 2)(a + 5)
Now let us express fractions with common denominators
- 2 2 — 2x(a+5) [Multiplying numerator
a—4 (a+2)(a-2) (a+2)(a—2)x(a+5) and denominator by
(a+5)]
_ 2a+5)
(@ —Ha+95)
And 5 _ 5 _ Sx(a+2) [Multiplying the
nd ———— 5. numerator and
a +3a-10 (a-2)(a+5) (a-2)a+5)x(a+2) denominator by
_ 5a+2) (a+2)]
(@ —4)(a+5)
.. The required fractions are _ Aad) | _Sa+2)
(@ —4)a+5 (a —4(a+5)
Example 6. Transform the fractions into its common denominator:
S28
43x XP +5x+6 F-x-12
Solution: Denominator of the first fraction is = x> + 3x = x(x + 3)
