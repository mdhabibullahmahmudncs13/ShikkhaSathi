========================================

So, many researchers have been started becoming concerned about radioactivity
and the determination of the safe limit of radioactivity is also started. General
people are now being warned about the effects of radioactivity (figure 13.02).
13.2 Development of Electronics
Electronics has a greatest contribution in the development of the modern
civilization and it is not an exaggeration by any means. The gradual
development of electronics can be divided into three parts, the vacuum tube,
transistor and integrated circuit.
13.2.1 Vacuum Tube
In 1883 Edison observed that in a light bulb, a current can flow through a
vacuum space from the filament to a metal plate. This process is known as the
Edison Effect. In 1904, John Flemming (on the basis of the Edison effect) first
