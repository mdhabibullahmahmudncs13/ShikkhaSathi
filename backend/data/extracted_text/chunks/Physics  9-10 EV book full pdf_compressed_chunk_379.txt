State of Matter and Pressure 129
5.1 Pressure
Though we use the word ‘pressure’ in our everyday conversation in many ways,
the word has a definite meaning in physics. We have talked about applying many
kinds of forces at different times in the previous chapters. But how the force will
be applied was untold. For example you can push a stone with your one hand,
two hands or with your whole body (Fig. 5.01). Though you apply the same
amount of force every time, the pressure will be different. In the first case you
applied force through the area of your palm. If your applied force is F, area of
your palm is A then the pressure
p= F

Unit of pressure: —= or Pa (Pascal)
