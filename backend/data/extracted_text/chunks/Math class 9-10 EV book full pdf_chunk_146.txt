Chapter 3. Algebraic Expressions 59
Middle Term Break-Up: By middle term break-up method of polynomial of
the form of az? + bx +c would be az? + br +c = (rz +p) (sz +q) if az’ + br +c =
rsa? + (rq + sp)x + pg. That is, a = rs, b = rq + sp and ¢ = pg. Hence,
ac = rspq = (rq)(sp) and b = rq + sp. Therefore, to determine factors of the
polynomial ax? + bx + ¢, ac, that is, the product of the coefficient of 2? and the
term free from z are to be expressed into two such factors whose algebraic sum is
equal to b, the coefficient of x.
Example 26. Resolve into factors: 31% — x — 14
Solution: 32? — x — 14 = 32% — Tr + 67 — 14
