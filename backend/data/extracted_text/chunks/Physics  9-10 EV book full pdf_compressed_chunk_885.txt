========================================

magnets, which generally don’t act as a magnet as they are aligned in different

directions. These substances consist of an enormous number of small

magnets that are randomly oriented. Since the small magnets are randomly

oriented, the piece of iron does not act as a magnet.

But when this piece is kept inside a solenoid or a coil, and if current is passed
.. through the solenoid, then the magnetic field produced by that current aligns the
§ individual tiny magnets.
