========================================

just the same amount of current comes back to the lower potential.
(b) The amount of current that enters at any point of a circuit, the same amount
of current will come out from that point, that is, there is no creation or
destruction of current in a circuit. No charge is created here, only transfer of
charge occurs.
(c) In a circuit Ohm's law is true for two points in any part, that is, if the potential
difference of those two points is divided by the resistance of that part, the current
flowing through the circuit can be determined.
