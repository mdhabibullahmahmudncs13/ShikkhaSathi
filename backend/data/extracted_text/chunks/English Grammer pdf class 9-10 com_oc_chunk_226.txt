The Adverb 115
7/3: Adverbials
A Read the following questions and think of their answers:
When will you see me?
Where are you going now?
How is it raining?
How frequently does he visit you?
Why are you waiting here?
Each of the first four questions can be answered by using a single word. For
example, you can say:
| shall see you tomorrow.
| am going downstairs.
It is raining hard /heavily.
He scarcely visits me.
These single words are adverbs. You have seen their use in the preceding
lessons. But you can answer any of the above questions by using a group of
words. For example, you can say:
| shall see you in the afternoon.
| am going to school.
It is raining very hard.
He visits me thrice a week.
| am waiting here to receive my friend.
