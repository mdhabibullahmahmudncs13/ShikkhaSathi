sometimes it focuse to a point (converging ray) or sometimes it diverges
(diverging ray) and the image is formed. That image is sometimes real and
sometimes virtual. Sometimes it is big, sometimes it is small. Using these images
in many ways, optical instruments have been
developed.
Many types of images are made by convex or
concave mirrors which also be made by
lenses and they are used in many ways. We
