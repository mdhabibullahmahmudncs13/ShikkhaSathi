========================================

There are many practical aspects of reducing density of the air with height.
When a plane flies in the

sky, the friction of air acts

as abig problem. The higher ~~ 10

we go, the density of wind g 08

will be reduced, and friction <

will also be reduced. Therefore, g iE

really big planes try to fly E04

through as high as possible = 02

in the sky. Generally it may

seem that why do the planes 0 5 0 15 0 25

not fly height at very big as Height (km)

then the friction will be

decreased further. The Figure 5.09: Air pressure reduces with height.
reason is that the planes
