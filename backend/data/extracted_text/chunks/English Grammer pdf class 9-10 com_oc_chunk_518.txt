========================================

My grandfather took me to the Head Teacher for admission, completed
some formalities, gave me some advice and left me in the school. But five
minutes after my grandfather had left, | felt so helpless among these
strangers that | decided not to continue. Within moments, | took my bag
and started running after my grandfather. | managed to overtake him in a
few minutes, but he was surprised to see me thus run away from school. He
tried to take me back to the school, but | started crying piteously. This
moved my grandfather, who carried me back home. When | think of this
now, it provokes laughter.
