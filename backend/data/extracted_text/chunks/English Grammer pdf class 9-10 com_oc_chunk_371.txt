========================================

use the active if the subject of the verb needs to be focused. But if the action
itself is important, then we use passive form.
Sometimes we use by+agent, when both action and agent (doer) are
important to be focused. for example .
Piya: Look, these paintings are quite interesting, aren't they?
Lira: Sure! They should be. They are painted by Jainul Abedin!
Piya: And what about that one — people with big muscles?
Lira: You really don’t know? That's painted by SM Sultan. All figures of Sultan
«are muscular.
