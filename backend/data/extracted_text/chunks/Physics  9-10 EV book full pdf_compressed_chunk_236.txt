========================================

object of mass m from the centre of the earth. This is not the distance of mass m
from the earth’s surface. Since the earth radius is too large (approximately 6370
km), therefore the small distances over the earth surface are not considered. The
distance is measured from the centre of the earth because for a spherical body if
it is considered that all its mass is centered at the centre, then no error occurs.
(Because each point of the earth attracts the mass m towards itself and if all the
attractions are assembled, it seems that the total mass is concentrated at the
centre of the earth!)
The mass m experiences acceleration due to the force of gravitation of the earth.
Already we have said that the acceleration due to gravity is expressed by g instead
ofa.
