========================================

the side AB extended at F. Find the midpoint G of the line segment AF. At A
of the line segment AG, draw GAK equal to Zz and draw AK || GH through G.
Again, draw KDH || AG through D and let, KDH intersects AK and GH at K
and H respectively. Hence AGHK is the required parallelogram.
Proof: Join D, F. By construction AGHK is a parallelogram, where ZGAK =
Zz. Again, area of ADAF = area of the rectangular region ABC'D and area of the
parallelogram AGH IK = area of the triangular region DAF Therefore, AGHK is
the required parallelogram.
