========================================

(1) The body at higher temperature gives heat to the body at the lower

temperature until they reach thermal equilibrium.

(2) The amount of heat given up by the bodies at higher temperature will be

equal to the heat gained by the bodies at the lower temperature. (We assume

that no heat is lost in this process by any other means.)
0) Example
Question: A piece of ice of mass 100 gm is dropped into water of 1 liter at
temperature 30 °C. What will be the temperature of the water after melting the
whole piece of ice? .
(Latent heat of ice L=334 kJ/kg) sg
