========================================

the direction of the current is again changed, it will not stop there. Rather, it will
continue its rotation. That’s why, when it reaches one stable position, if current
in it flows in such a way that it
experiences a rotational force due to DO
repulsion, then it will continue to
rotate.
In order to change the direction of
current, we have to use a mechanical © Nl 5
technique with the help of a simple
device called a commutator. The two [S| LISS,
wires of the electromagnet are placed
on two sides of the rotating axis
around which the main coil rotates in
such a way that it touches two
terminals of the main electric current
at the commutator. When the
terminals touch it, then it will flow the
current in such a way that it tries to . |
