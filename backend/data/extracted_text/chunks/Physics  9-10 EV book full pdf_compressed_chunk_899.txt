========================================

the magnetic field can be removed. Keeping the second coil near the first coil,
if a magnetic field is produced once in it and the magnetic field is removed
again, then the magnetic field will be changed in the first coil and due to this we
will see current in the ammeter! When current is produced by turning on the
switch, then the ammeter will show the presence of the current by deflecting its
needle in one direction. When the switch is turned off, the needle will deflect in
another direction, and show the current flowing in the opposite direction.
One thing we have to remember: when the magnetic field changes, only then
does the current flow. If a strong magnet is kept inside a coil, no current will
flow through the coil. Only by moving the coil, the magnetic field is changed,
