========================================

state which indicates whether an object ike the volume of liquid

absorbs or rejects heat when it comes in contact with another object. To

understand this, we can compare it with the height of the surface of water in

(Figure 6.01).

If the heights of the upper surface of water in the two containers are different,

and they are connected with a pipe, the flow of water will not be determined by

which container contains more or less water. Water flow will depend on the

height of the upper surface of water of the containers. Always water will flow

from higher height to lower height until the two heights become equal. Here we
