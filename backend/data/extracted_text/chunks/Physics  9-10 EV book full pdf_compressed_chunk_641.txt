At a distance greater than focal distance
Among all the images we have seen so far, this image is amazing, because we
will witness a real image for the first time, where light will be centralized where
the image will be created (Figure 8.23).
Let, the object be XY and like other
cases, the image of point Y will be on the
line YP. We have to draw two lines in 2
order to determine the image of point X. ~~ ;
One line XQ will be parallel to the axis, -
and after reflection it traverses through 1
the focal point F as QF. We can draw the i
second ray through the point F. This will ~~ R R s
reflect in the concave mirror and after
reflecting, it will become parallel to Rg, Figure 8.23: The image becomes inverted if
