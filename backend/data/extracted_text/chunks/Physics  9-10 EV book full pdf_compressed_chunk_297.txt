102 Physics
is not mentioned as energy, we can assume that light is one kind energy too. The
energy which is not mentioned in our daily conversation, but will be discussed a
lot in physics is kinetic energy. We may think that there are many types of energy
in nature, but it is interesting that all kinds of energy are the same and we can
only transform them from one to another! So what is energy?
Ability to do work is energy! Not only that, when a positive work is done by
applying a force on an object, the force creates an energy in that object. The
amount of work done on the object is the amount of energy created in it, and the
person who is applying the force has to give exactly the same amount of energy.
