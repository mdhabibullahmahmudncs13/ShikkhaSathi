Equiangular Polygons: If the angles of two polygons with equal number of
sides are sequentially equal, the polygons are known as equiangular polygons.

Similar Polygons: If the vertices of two polygons with equal number of sides
can be matched in such a sequential way that
(7) The matching angles are equal and (7) The ratios of matching sides are
equal, then the two polygons are called similar polygons.
In the above figures, the rectangle ABC'D and the square PQRS are equiangular
since the number of sides in both the figures is 4 and the angles of the rectangle
are sequentially equal to the angles of the square (all right angles). Though the
