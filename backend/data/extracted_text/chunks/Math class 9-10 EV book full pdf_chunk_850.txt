Frequency
Here, n = 51 is an odd number.
. 51+1
.. Median = the value of — th term = the value of26th term = 165
Required median 165 cm.
Note: The value of the terms from 23th to 38th is 165.
Example 11. The frequency distribution table of marks obtained in
mathematics of 60 students is as follows. Find the median :
Marks 40 | 45 | 50 | 55 70180 | 85 | 90 | 95 | 100
obtained
Solution: Cumulative frequency distribution table for determining median is :
Marks 40 | 45 | 50 | 55 | 60 | 70 | 80 | 85 | 90 | 95 | 100
