========================================

1) AB=15 AC =25 a
BC = AC? — AB? = /(25)% — (15)? = /400 = 20

2) Area of AABC = 1BC -AB = JAC -BD D

15am 25m
es BD = SBC -AB
5.25 x BD =20 x15 p c
BD =12
3) From right-angled triangle AABD we get,
AD? + BD? = AB?
or, AD? +12? = 15°
or, AD? = 225 — 144 = 81
SAD =9and CD = AC — AD =25-9=16
So, ratio of areas of AABD and ABCD is:
1
AABD ;BD-AD 9
ABCD 3 Bp.cp 16
AABD : ABCD =9: 16
Exercise 16.1

1. The hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is 25 m. If one of its remaining
two sides is s of the other, find the length of the two sides.

2. A ladder with length 20 m. stands vertically against a wall. How much
further should the lower end of the ladder be moved so that its upper end
descends 4 metre?
