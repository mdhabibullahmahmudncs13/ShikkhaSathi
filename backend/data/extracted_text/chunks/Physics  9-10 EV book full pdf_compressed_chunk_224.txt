========================================

Place two adjacent books parallely and put four or five marbles in the

gaps so that all the marbles are touching one another (Figure 3.05).

Hit the row of marbles by knocking with a marble. You will see that if you

strike with one marble on one side, one marble will come out from the other

side; two marbles will come out if the strike is done with two marbles. You

will never be able to bring out two marbles striking with one marble or

bring out one marble striking with two marbles. gq
