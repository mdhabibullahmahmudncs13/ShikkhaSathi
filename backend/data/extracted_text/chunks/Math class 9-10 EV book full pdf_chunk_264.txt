========================================

g

50m
Solution: Let the path be x metre wide.
Without the path length of the garden is (50 — 2x) metre and breadth is (40 — 2x)
metre
.. Without the path area of the garden = (50 — 2x) x (40 — 2x) square metre
By the question, (50 — 2x) x (40 — 2x) = 1200
or, 2000 — 80x — 100x + 42% = 1200
or, 42? — 180x + 800 = 0
or, 2% — 45x + 200 = 0 [dividing by 4]
or, 2° — 5x — 40x + 200 = 0
or, z(z —5) —40(x —5) = 0
or, (x —5)(x — 40) = 0
sr—=5=0o0rx—40=0
ifr —-5=0,z=5
a
BS if 2 —40 = 0, x = 40

But the breadth of the path will be less than 40 metre from the breadth of the

garden.

Sox #40; x =5

.. the path is 5 metres wide
