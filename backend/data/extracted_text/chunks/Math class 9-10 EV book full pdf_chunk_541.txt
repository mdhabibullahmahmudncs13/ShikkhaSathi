Example 14. If the sides of a square increase by 10%, how much will the area
be increased in percentage?
Solution: Let, each side of the square be a metre. Therefore, the area of the
square be a? square metre. If the side of the square increases by 10%, each side
will be (a + a of 10%) metre, or 1.10a metre. In this case, the area of the
square will be (1.10a)? square metre, or 1.214” square metre. Thus the the area
increases by (1.21a° — a?) = 0.21a* square metre.
. . 0.21a*
.". The percentage of increment of the area will be —— x 100% = 21%
