8.2.1 Laws of Reflection
Before understanding the laws of reflection, we need to define some terms.
When lights incident from one medium to another, for the time being we assume
that it is a plane surface. To understand better, we will assume that the light that
reflects is a light ray or a light beam. When a light ray from the first medium
to the second medium is incident on a point, first we have to imagine a
perpendicular at that point which is called a normal. Then imagine a plane that
contains this incident ray and the normal (Figure 8.03).
The ray, which is incident at a point,
from the first to the second medium
is called the incident ray (XO). The
ray which is reflected (OX) is called fir etm
the reflected ray. (You are realizing 9] P
