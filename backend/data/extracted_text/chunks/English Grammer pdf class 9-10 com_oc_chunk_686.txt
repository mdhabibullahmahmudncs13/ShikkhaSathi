========================================

8. Gap filling with right forms of verbs

Sentences will be written in context in the question paper. Some verbs could be omitted
or given in brackets without any form. IT the verbs are totally omitted in the text, a list
of verbs will be supplied in a box separately. Students’ job will be to use the verb at the
gaps in their correct forms according to the context and other grammatical
considerations. Alternatively base form of verbs can also be supplied in the body of the
text in parenthesis.

Students will write only the right answers with the question number. However, if
anyone uses the text with words at the gaps, it should be accepted as correct answer,
