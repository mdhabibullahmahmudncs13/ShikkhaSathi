========================================

We need to mention something here. Whenever we have discussed distanc-
es travelled, velocity or acceleration we always considered a
standard situation. We considered that when an object moves, there is no
friction and the object does not lose its energy by any other means. That
does not happen in real life. That is why it is not so easy to collect real data
for distances travelled, velocity or acceleration. For performing a real
experiment an air track is used in the laboratory, where an object is kept
floating in an air layer so that no friction is present. To measure the change
of position of an object with respect to time, electric sparks or electronic
signals are used. We will not get such type of data in our daily lives easily.
