1 il il Not only this, we can reach near this

| Pc I 273.15K 1 IPF this temperature. This temperature is
il ie te called the absolute zero temperature.
On Celsius scale the value of this
temperature is -273.15 °C. Therefore,
Figure 6.02: Celsius, Kelvin and in Kelvin scale its value is zero Kelvin.
Fahrenheit scales of temperature In other words it is said that the Kelvin
scale has been made considering the
absolute zero temperature as zero Kelvin.
To make any scale of temperature two certain temperatures (or fixed points) are
