Then, v=u, andv,=u,
@ Do Yourself

Right now you can do this experiment. Knock a stationary marble with anoth-

er marble of the same mass so that it collides with the stationary marble.

You will observe that the knocking marble will become stationary and the

stationary marble will move with the same velocity as of the knocking
