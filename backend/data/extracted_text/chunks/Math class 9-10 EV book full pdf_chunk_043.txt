========================================

Remarks:

1. The sum or difference of repeating decimal is also repeating decimal
fractions. In this sum or difference the number of digits in the non-repeating
part will be equal to the number of digits in the non- repeating part of that
repeating decimal fractions, which have the highest number of digits in its
non-repeating part. Similarly, the number of digits in the repeating part of the
sum or the result of subtraction will be the equal to L.C.M. of the numbers of
digits of repeating parts of repeating decimal fractions. If there are finite
decimal fractions, the number of digits in the nonrepeating part of each
repeating decimal fraction will be equal to the highest numbers of digits that
occurs after the decimal point.
