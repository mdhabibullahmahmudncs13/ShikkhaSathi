Now-a-days, we cannot spend a single moment properly without electricity. To
operate machines and other instruments around us, we need electricity. In the
previous chapter we discussed static electricity. When charge flows through a
conductor, we call it current electricity or, in brief, electricity. We will describe
the terms required to explain current electricity and learn the rules of flow of
electricity. In this chapter we will also discuss how we can measure electricity in
a circuit and potential difference.
