========================================

winter we create heat by rubbing our hands. The engine of a car becomes hot
that happens due to friction. Therefore, energy is dissipated by creating
unnecessary heat due to friction. Cars, planes, ships, submarines have to go
forward by overcoming the frictional force, requiring extra fuel. If we treat this
in this way, it may seem that friction is nothing but an evil in our lives.
Meanwhile, we have seen that due to friction we can walk, drive cars on the
road, write on the paper with pencil or pen, construct buildings, come down safely
with the help of a parachute. We can give many examples where without friction
we could not do our necessary work.
Consequently though friction is treated as an evil, we have to acknowledge that
friction is a very necessary evil for our lives.
