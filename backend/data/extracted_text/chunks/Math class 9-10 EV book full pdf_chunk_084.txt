of P(G) is 2°

Ordered Pair

Amena and Sumena of class VIII occupied 1st and 2nd position repectively in

the annual examination. According to merit this can be expressed as (Amena,

Sumena) pair. Similar definite pairs are called ordered pairs.

So, for a pair of elements if the positions are given and expressed, then the pair is

called Ordered Pair.

If the first element of an ordered pair is x, and the second element is y, then the

ordered pair is denoted by (z,y). For the ordered pairs (z,y) and (a,b) will the

equal or (z,y) = (a,b) if and only if x = a and y = b.

Example 11. If (22 + y,3) = (6,2 — y) then, determine (x.y).
