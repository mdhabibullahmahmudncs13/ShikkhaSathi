========================================

years, the ratio will be 8 : 3. What are their present ages?

Solution: Let the present age of father be a and that of the son be b.

So, by the conditions of first and second of the problems, we have,

a 7

—=—...(1

p=

a+5 8

—=—...(2

b+5 3 @

From equation(1),we get,

7b

1=—...(3

a=T.®

From equation(2),we get,

3(a+5)=8(b+5)

or, 3a + 15 = 8b + 40

or, 3a — 8b =40 — 15

7b .
or, 3 x 3 8b = 25 [by using(3)]
or, 21b — 16b _ 95
2
or, 5b = 50
