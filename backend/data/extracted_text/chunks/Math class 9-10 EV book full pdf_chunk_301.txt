lie. This line is called AB or BA line. By postulate 5(c) every such straight line
contains infinite number of points.
According to postulate 5(a) more than one plane
exist. There is infinite number of straight lines in
every such plane. The branch of geometry that ~
deals with points, lines lying in same plane and
different geometrical entities related to them, is known
as plane Geometry. In this textbook, plane geometry
is the matter of our discussion. Hence, whenever M
something is not mentioned in particular, we will
assume that all discussed points, lines etc lie in a plane.
Proof of Mathematical statements
In any mathematical theory different statements related to the theory are logically
