========================================

cm and height ¢ = 15 cm
.-. Area of the whole surface of the rectangular solid = 2(ab + be + ca)
=2(25 x 20 4 20 x 15 + 15 x 25) = 2350 square cm
and Volume = abc = 25 x 20 x 15 = 7500 cube cm
and length of its diagonal = Va? +b? + ¢2
= 1/252 + 20% + 152 = /624 + 400 + 225 = 1250 = 35.363 cm (approx. )
The required area of the whole surface is 2350 square cm, volume 7500 cubic
cm and length of its diagonal 35.363 cm (approx. ).
‘Work: Determine the volume, area of the whole surface and the length of
the diagonal of your mathematics book after measuring its length, width and
height.
Cube
If the length, width and height of a rectangular solid E H
are equal, it is called a cube. A
Let, ABCDEFGH is a cube. F
Its length = width = height = a units
1. The length of diagonal of the cube
