Here is one more example for rotational symmetry. Consider the intersection of
two diagonals of a square the centre of rotation. In the quarter turn about the
centre of the square, any diagonal position will be as like as the second figure. In
this way, when you complete four quarter-turns, the square reaches its original
position. It is said that a square has a rotational symmetry of order 4.
