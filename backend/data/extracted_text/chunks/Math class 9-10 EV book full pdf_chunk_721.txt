Let the parallelograms regions ABC'D and ABEL stand on the same base AB
and lie between the pair of parallel lines AB and FC. It is required to prove that,
area of the parallelogram ABCD = area of the parallelogram ABEF.
Drawing: Join A, C'and A, E. From the points C' and FE, draw perpendiculars
EK and CL to the base AB and extended AB respectively. 3
