========================================

Edison Effect. In 1904, John Flemming (on the basis of the Edison effect) first
created a vacuum tube with two electrodes, which worked as a rectifier i.e., it
converted an alternating current into a direct current. This vacuum tube is
considered as the introduction to electronics. At that time the exchange of
information was started by radio waves. Guglielmo Marconi needed such type of
vacuum tube to control of the radio waves. (It is noted that Marconi was
mentioned as the inventor of radio, but in recent times the contribution of
Bengali scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose is also acknowledged.)
In 1906 Lee De Forest invented another vacuum tube by adding a third
electrode, which is known by the name triode. This triode can control the flow
of electricity and used as an amplifier.
