Writing Summaries 281
We read different kinds of material in different ways. We don't always read
everything at the same speed. With certain kinds of material we need to read
slowly and carefully, for example, when we are trying to understand difficult
ideas in a text like science or economics books. We also read directions and
instructions slowly and carefully. We usually read stories, magazines,
newspapers, where the material is usually written in an easily understandable
way, at a normal speed, neither too slow nor too fast. Whereas, when we read
something we have read before, or we know about, we usually read very
rapidly. A good reader suits his or her speed to what he or she reads.
Skimming and scanning are additional ways of helping us read more efficiently.
