========================================

f(z), if and only if f (-3) =0.

bY ; b
Proof: a #0, ax+b =a (2+ — | will be a factor of f(z), if and only if { x + —

a a
=z — (-3) is a factor of f(x). Hence, if and only if f (-3) = 0. This

a a
method of determining the factor by using remainder theorem is called Vanishing
method.
Example 30. Resolve into factors: 2° —z — 6
pS Solution: Here, f(x) = 2° — x — 6 is a polynomial. The factors of the constant
BS —6 are +1, +2, +3, £6.
