========================================

of 50 m/s. At what height will the potential and kinetic energy be the same?
Answer: Initial kinetic energy of the body is
1, 1 ;
Ty ==mv?==x5x50%]=6250]
2 2
When kinetic energy equals potential energy, then for height /, we can say
kinetic energy = potential energy
kinetic energy + potential energy = primary kinetic energy
kinetic energy = potential energy = primary kinetic energy/2
4 6250)

You may have already guessed that this problem also does not depend on the
mass.
