3. Since ZDEF+/DEG=1 2
right angle + 1 right angle = 2
right angles = 1 straight angle,
GEF forms a straight line.
Therefore, ADGF is an isosceles" Fo 5 x LC
triangle with DG=DF. So,
LF=/G=/C.
4. Now, in AABC and ADEF:
/B=/E [Both 1 right angle]
LC=/F
AB=DE [By Angle-Side-Angle Theorem]
Therefore, AABC=ADEF (Proved).
Theorem 12:
If one side of a triangle is greater than another side, the angle opposite the
greater side will be greater than the angle opposite the smaller side.
Special Nomination: Suppose in AABC, AC>AB. A
We need to prove that ZABC>ZACB.
Drawing: From AC, cut off a part AD equal to AB and
join B and D. 4 c
Proof:
1. In AABD, AB=AD.
Hence, ZADB=/ABD [Since in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the
