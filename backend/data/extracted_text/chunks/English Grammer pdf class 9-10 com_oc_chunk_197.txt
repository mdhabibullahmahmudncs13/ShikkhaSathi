We intend to make it bigger than the present one.

We've managed to buy a good plot and expect to finish the legal

formalities soon. We've already arranged to appoint an

internationally reputed architect.

dreams come true, but this time | plan nat te fail.

We also use the to infinitive after some verbs connected with thinking, such as
decide, forget, remember, etc.

e.g. I've decided to do some part-time job during the summer
holidays. And although | remembered to discuss it with
my best friend in school, | forgot to tell my parents about
it.

We use the to infinitive after some verbs connected with saying that we will or
