One problem that plagues beginning teachers, and older teachers as well, is the
seeming lack of self- control of underprivileged children. Because their homes
are often characterized by an awful lot of fragmentation and instability, their
behaviour reflects their inability to keep real cool in situations involving adults.

understanding. For the teacher to be able to exhibit this kind of behavior when
confronting a bunch of adolescents, he must have achieved terrific level of
integration and security, so that his own psychic life is completely okay.
