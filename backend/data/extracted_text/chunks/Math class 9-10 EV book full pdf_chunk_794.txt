Rectangular solid
The region surrounded by three pairs of parallel rectangular planes or surfaces is
known as rectangular solid.
Let, ABCDEFGH is a rectangular solid, whose length AB = a, and breadth
BC = b and height AH = c.
1. Determining the diagonal: AF is the diagonal of the rectangular solid
ABCDEFGH.
In AABC, BC 1. AB and AC is the hypotenuse.
LAC? = AB? + BC? = a + 1?
Again, in AABC, FC L AC and AF is hypotenuse.
SLAF? = ACP + CFP =a? +P +
AF = VETETE
