========================================

The intersection of two lines produces a point. That is, the place of intersection
of two lines is denoted by a point. For example, the two edges of a box meet at a
point. A point has no length, breadth and thickness. If the length of a line is gradually
reduced to zero, at last it ends in a point. Thus, a point is considered an entity of
zero dimension.
Euclid’s Axioms and Postulates
The discussion above about surface, line and point do not lead to any definition —
they are merely description. This description refers to height, breadth and length,
neither of which has been defined. We only can represent them intuitively. The
definitions of point, line and surface which Euclid mentioned in the beginning of
the first volume of his ‘Elements’ are incomplete from modern point of view. A
