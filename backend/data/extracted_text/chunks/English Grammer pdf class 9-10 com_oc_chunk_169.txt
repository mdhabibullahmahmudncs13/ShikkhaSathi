84 English Grammar and Compasition
5/4: Will/Won’t
and Would

We have already discussed the use of Will and Shall to express future facts or

events. These are modal auxiliaries, and go before the main verb, and do not

change.

A Read the following passage and notice the use of will, won't and would
as modal auxiliaries:

a. My family and | will go to attend my cousin's wedding tomorrow at
Munshiganj. Father has already made all the arrangements. We will first
take a bus to the Sadarghat, and then we will go by a steamer to
Munshiganj. We will stay there overnight and will come back the next
evening. I'm a little sad that | won't go to school tomorrow and the day
after, but | don’t want to miss all the fun at the wedding either.

b. : Hello, Rupam!
