308 Physics
For a certain material, p is specific Table 11.01 : Specific resistance of matter
resistance and its unit is Q m.
Specific resistance (QQm)

To measure how conducting a 1.59 x 1078
substance is, a term called 1.68 x 108
conductivity ¢ has been introduced. 2.44 x 10-8
The more a substance is electrically - —
conducting, the more isthe value of the Graphite 2:50 x 10
electrical conductivity. It is reciprocal 1.00 x 1012
to the specific resistance oc. (Table 1.30 x 1016
11.01)
