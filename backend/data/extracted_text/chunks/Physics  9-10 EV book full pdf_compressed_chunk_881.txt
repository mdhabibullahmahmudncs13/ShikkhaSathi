Figure 12.02: Directions of the compasses around electric current
Now, if the current is stopped, then again the compasses align along the
north-south direction. If the direction of current is changed, you will find that the
compasses will arrange themselves again, but now the direction of the
compasses in the circle will be reversed. This is because the current always
produces a magnetic field around it in a definite direction.
If current flows through a conducting wire, then the direction of the magnetic
lines of force produced due to this can be obtained from the right hand rule. If
the thumb indicates the direction of current, then the other fingers will indicate
the direction of the magnetic field ( Figure 12.03).
