========================================

[o Read the following passage and identify the different kinds of
adverbials in it:
One day | was sitting alone upon a bench at a park near my house. Suddenly, a
young girl arrived there. She was beautifully dressed. She sat beside me and
began to talk with me very cordially. We talked for about half an hour and then
we began to walk together. Within a short time we became good friends.
When we parted, we promised never to forget each other. We now phone
each other every day. We visit each other almost regularly.
