Work, Power, Energy 103
Answer: You have done work, Fe"
W=Fs=100 N x10 m=1000 J=1 kJ.
Work done by the frictional force, ff
W=Fs=-10N x10 m=-100J
The stone has attained energy because iF AR) ) Hie

also be generated. Figure 4.01: when a force is applied
on a body, frictional force acts in the
opposite direction.
4.3 Different forms of energy
We use different kinds of energy for different purposes. For example, heat
energy is needed for water to be heated, we need light energy to see anything, we
hear by using sound energy. We run machines by using electrical energy, and we
create electricity from electric cells by using chemical energy. We generate
