Distance and Elevation
From very ancient times trigonometric ratios are applied to find the distance and
height of any distant object. At present trigonometric ratios are of boundless
importance because of its increasing usage. The heights of the hills, mountains
towers, trees and the widths of those rivers which cannot be measured in ordinary
method are measured with the help of trigonometry. It is necessary to know the
trigonometrical ratios values of acute angles in this regard.
At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to —
» explain the geoline, vertical plane and angles of elevation and declination.
» solve mathematical problem related to distance and height with the help of
trigonometry.
