========================================

4. Gap filling with or without clues

The text in the gap filling activity is separate and complete. The text for this item will
have a meaningful context too. There will be five gaps in the text. The gaps can be used
for article, preposition, or any other parts of speech without verb as there is separate test
for it. A question setter will choose one particular ilem mentioned earlier to set a
question and use a gap at the particular place. For example, if the question setter wants
10 test the article then there will be a gap at the position of a, an, the or before a noun
that does not take any article. For a question of 3 marks, there will be six gaps in the
text; for 4, there will be 8 gaps; and for 5 marks there will be ten gaps.
