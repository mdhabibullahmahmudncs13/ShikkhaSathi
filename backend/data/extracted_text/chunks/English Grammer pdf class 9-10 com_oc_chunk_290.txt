A Read the following conversation:

Zinia : Yes, it is indeed. We're going to stay the whole night, aren’t we?
Sam : Ithink so. By the way, | haven't seen you for a long time.
Zinia : lwas in the USA for six weeks.
Sam : Oh, really? You didn’t go there on business, did you?
Zinia : No, | didn’t. Actually | went there to attend my brother's graduation
ceremany.
Sam : You are not going away anywhere soon, are you?
Zinia : No, I'm not. You missed me, didn’t you?

with a question. These questions are different from the wh-questions or
‘yes/no’ questions. These are called tag questions.
