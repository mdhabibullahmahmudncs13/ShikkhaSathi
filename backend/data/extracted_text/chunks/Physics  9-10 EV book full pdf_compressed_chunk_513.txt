is applied. During vaporization of liquid the amount of heat by which the whole
liquid is converted into a gas, that heat is called Latent Heat of Vaporization.

Figure 6.08 : Melting and boiling point does not change during heat.
After converting the whole liquid into a gas the temperature of the gas continues
to increase if heat is being applied. If the temperature is raised to
extremely high levels, the molecules will become ionized and a fourth state of
matter called plasma will start to form but this is something different.
All of us have seen at least one example of the process by which solids can be
converted into liquids and liquids into gases, that one is ice converted into water
