========================================

pressure will be felt after going in deep water or any other fluid is already been
mentioned. The pressure on you will have to be calculated from the weight of the
column of liquid on you. Let us suppose that you want to determine the pressure
of the liquid at depth A. Imagine an area A there (Figure 5.02). The weight of the
column of liquid above this area will exert a force on 4.
Volume of the liquid over a surface area
A is Ah. If the density of the liquid is p gre
then weight of this liquid or force is, =
F=mg = (Ahp)g —

Therefore pressure,

Therefore, in a liquid of fixed density,
pressure rises with the increase of depth. .
In case of water, approximately for a ten Figure 5.02: Pressure is created on
