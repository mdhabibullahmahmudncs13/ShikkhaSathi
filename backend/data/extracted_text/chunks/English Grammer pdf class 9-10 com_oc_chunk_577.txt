My Mother's Village
(From N.C. Chaudhury’s Autobiography of an Unknown Indian)
To pass from Banagram (where the writer's ancestral home was located)
to my mother’s village, Kalikachcha or Kalikutch, was to pass into a
world so different, so humble, so full of humility, and so self effacing in
bamboo and cane greenery, that it brought tears to one’s eyes...The
country round Kalikutch was open, but the village itself was thickly
wooded, in places so thickly as to have the appearance of a tropical
forest. It was only at Kalikutch on our side of East Bengal that | saw thick
undergrowth at the foot of tall trees, climbers of all sports and cane
clinging to them, and bamboo, reed, and scrub all jumbled together.
