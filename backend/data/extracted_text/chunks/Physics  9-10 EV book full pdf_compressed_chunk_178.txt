========================================

5.Do we travel double the distance at double the time in case of uniform
acceleration?

Mathematical question

1. From your school a car has gone 40 km east, then 40 km north, then 30 km
west, then 30 km south, then 20 km east, then 20 km north, then 10 km west,
then 10 km south. In which direction and how far is the car from your
school?

2. Show when velocity and acceleration become positive, negative or zero on
the portions OA, AB, BC and CD in figure 2.11.

3. If position is plotted along the Y- axis instead of velocity then what would be
the value of velocity and acceleration on the portions OA, AB, BC and CD
in the figure 2.11.
