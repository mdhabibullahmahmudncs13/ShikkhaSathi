(9 Example
Question: A force of 10 N is applied on a stationary object of mass 10 kg for 10
s. (a) What is the kinetic energy of the object? (b) Calculate the kinetic energy
after 20 s. (c) If the force is applied for 20 s, then what is the kinetic energy?
Answer: Acceleration due to 10 N force is:
_F_aov
4m Tokg m/s
Therefore velocity after 10 second: 1
m
v=at=-X 10s =10m/s
(a) Then the kinetic energy,
Zmv? =2x10x 10%] =500]
(b) Acceleration will take place for 10 s, after that no acceleration is present,
so velocity is unchanged, therefore kinetic energy after 20 s will be the same.
(c) If force is applied for 20 s, then the velocity is,
v=at=1m/s?x20s=20m/s
Therefore the kinetic energy,
! 2110x202 = 2000
smu? = J = 2000]
