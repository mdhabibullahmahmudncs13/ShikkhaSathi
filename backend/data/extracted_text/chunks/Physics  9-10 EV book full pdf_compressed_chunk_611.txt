Reflection of Light 219

8.2.3 Reflection from smooth and rough planes

Parallel light rays become parallel after reflecting from mirrors or smooth plane

surfaces because each ray obeys the law of reflection and reflects with an angle

of reflection equal to the angle of incidence. Even if the plane is not smooth,

every ray of light will obey the law of reflection. But the rays are incident at

different angles at different points of the plane, therefore the rays will reflect in

different angles after reflection. After reflection, the reflected rays are not

parallel and spread in different directions. (Figure 8.07) These types of

reflections are called irregular reflection.
