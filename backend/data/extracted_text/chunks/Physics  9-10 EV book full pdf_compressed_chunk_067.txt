1.5.4 Scientific symbols and notations

The following methods are followed to write the symbol of units:

1. To express the value of a quantity, first we write a number, leave a
space after it and then write the symbol of the unit. For example, 2.21
kg, 7.3 x 102 m? or 22 K. The percentage (%) sign also follows the same rule.
However no space is left after a number to write degrees (°) minutes (") and seconds (*").

2. Derived unit produced by multiplication is written using a space between
two units, e.g. 2.35 Nm

3. Derived unit produced by division is expressed as negative power or slash
(e.g. ms~! or m/s)

4. No punctuation mark or period is used with the symbols, as they are
mathematical expressions but not the abbreviated form of anything.
