Figure 9.25: If the object is placed at a distance twice the focal length, the
size of the image will be same as the object.
(a) The position of the image will be on the twice of the focal length
(b) It is real
(c) Itis inverted
(d) It is the same size as the object
(iii) Now let's see if the object is
placed outside at a distance xX c
twice of the focal length. Where a)

object is formed? ® - li
