State of Matter and Pressure 155
Gases can be turned into plasma by giving excessive heat; plasma also be made
by a powerful electric field. In our house, plasma is created in a tube light. There
is also plasma in the luminous advertisement of neon light. The light which is
seen during thunder is also plasma and the substances which remain in the far
stars is also in the plasma state. At present, we use nuclear energy in fission
process by breaking a heavy nucleus. We try to use plasma for creating energy in
fusion process combining the light nucleuses and now this is a very important
field of research in physics.
