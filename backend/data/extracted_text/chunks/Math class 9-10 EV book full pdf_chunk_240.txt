the equation
5. All algebraic identities >quations,
5. All equations are not identities. g algebraic identities are equations
Work:
1) What is the degree of and how many roots has each of the following
equations?
2y y—1 3y
1) 3x +1=5 2) ——0—=—=
(1) 3e+ ER
2) Write down three identities.
Solving Linear Equations
In case of solving equations, some rules are to be applied. If the rules are known,
solution of equations becomes easier. The rules are as follows:
1. If the same number or quantity is added to both sides of an equation, two
sides remain equal.
2. If the same number or quantity is subtracted from both sides of an equation,
two sides remain equal.
3. If both sides of an equation are multiplied by the same number or quantity,
the two sides remain equal.
