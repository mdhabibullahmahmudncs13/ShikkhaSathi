Congruence of Triangles
If a triangle when placed on another exactly A
covers the other, the triangles are congruent. The
corresponding sides and angles of two congruent
triangles are equal.
In the adjacent figure, AABC and ADEF are B c
congruent. If two triangles AABC and ADEF are D
congruent and vertices A, B, C superpose on vertices
D, E, F respectively, then AB = DE, AC = DF,
BC =FEFand ZA=/D,/B=/FE,/C=/F. To
express AABC and ADEF congruent it is written E F
as AABC = ADEF.
Theorem 5.  (Side-Angle-Side criterion) 4
If two sides and the angle included between them of
a triangle are equal to two corresponding sides and
the angle included between them of another triangle, B Cc
the triangles are congruent. D
Let AABC and ADEF be two triangles in which
