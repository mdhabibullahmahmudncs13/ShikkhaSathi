========================================

applied on that object. Hitting the wall, the gas molecules apply a force on the
wall. According to Newton’s third law, the wall also applies a counter force on
the molecule thus reflecting the molecule.
An enormous number of molecules thus hit the walls of the container and this
combined force appears as the pressure of the gas.If the temperature of the gas is
increased, then the kinetic energies of the molecules will increase and the
molecules will hit the wall harder. This means the pressure will be increased.
We will see in the next chapter that due to the application of heat, temperature
increases and as a result pressure also increases.
