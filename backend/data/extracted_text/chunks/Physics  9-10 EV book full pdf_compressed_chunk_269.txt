Figure 3.18: Measurement of kinetic friction
Static friction and Kinetic friction
Take several empty match boxes. Fill up the boxes with soil to make
them slightly heavier. Now put a match box on a book and keep sliding
the book gradually (Figure 3 .18). Due to the static friction the match will
not slide at first. When the book becomes sufficiently inclined, then
along the slope a force works. At the instant when this force equals the
sliding frictional force, then the match box will start sliding. You will see
that only for a particular angle of inclination the match will start moving.
Putting one or more match boxes over the first one repeat the experiment;
