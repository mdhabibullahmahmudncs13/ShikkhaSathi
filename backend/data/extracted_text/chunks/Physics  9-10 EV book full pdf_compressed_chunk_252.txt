other, producing zero? For this reason, the third law will have to be written very
precisely. The third law states that if there are two objects A and B, then when A
exerts a force on B, then B also exerts a force on A. It is worth mentioning that

forces were applied on a single object, only then one could cancel the other. Here
there is no scope of cancellation.
