========================================

ionizing air molecule-atoms ans travels approximately 6 cm through air before
stopping. An alpha particle can be stopped by using a sheet of paper. It creates
phosphorescence on zinc sulfide screen. An alpha particle creates many free
electrons by ionizing molecule-atoms of air in its path of motion. Its presence
can be detected or its energy can be measured easily by collecting these free
electrons.
When a alpha particle comes out from a larger radioactive nucleus then this
nucleus’s atomic number will be reduced by two and its nucleon number willbe
reduced by four, because an alpha particle consists of two protons and two ~~ &
