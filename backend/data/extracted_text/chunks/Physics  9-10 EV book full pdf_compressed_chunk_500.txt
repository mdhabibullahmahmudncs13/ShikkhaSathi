Effect of Heat on Matter 173
heated needs to be considered. So the expansion of a liquid in a container
observed is not real expansion, it is an apparent expansion. Therefore, to
measure the real expansion, the expansion of the container must be kept in mind
always. Usually, the expansion of liquids is more z
than that of liquids. If it was not the case we could
not see the apparent expansion. It seems to be
apparent compression!
The most common example of the expansion of Ii
liquid is a thermometer. There are many types of f
thermometers, among them perhaps the clinical |
thermometer (Figure 6.05) is the most familiar.
A glass tube contains mercury at the bottom. If heat
is applied, the volume of mercury is increased and it «— Fine curve
