Selection of Tools and Acquaintance of Move Tools

- 3 selection tools and 1 move tool are viewed on the top of the tool box. At the
bottom of the right side of some tools, a small arrow sign Z is viewed. It
indicates that in the same position, more tools of the similar types remain
there, For example, 4 Marquee tools in the same position and 3 Lasso tools
in different positions are there.

- Place the mouse pointer on the tool, and the name of the tool will be
viewed. Click the tool to activate it. If the mouse pointer is brought inside
the screen, it will be viewed either in the own shape of the selected tool or
with a plus (+) sign.

- Making squares, circles and objects is possible with the marquee tool within
the selected tool.
