4.5 Conservation and Transformation of Energy
4.5.1 Conservation of energy
In our daily life, the energy we see around us is imperishable. It has no
destruction, it transforms only from one form to another form. When a stone is
raised, it develops a potential energy. When the stone is released, the potential
energy starts decreasing and the kinetic energy starts increasing. Just before it
touches the ground, its total energy is converted into kinetic energy. But when
the stone stops after touching the ground, then it contains no kinetic energy and
no potential energy, where has the energy gone?
