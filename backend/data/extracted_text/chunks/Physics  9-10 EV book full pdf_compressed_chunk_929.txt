When an alpha particle is emitted from a nucleus, it comes out with a definite
amount of energy. But in the case of a beta particle, this is not true. The energy
of the beta particle depends on the part of the total energy radiation received by
the anti-neutrino.
Since a beta particle is negatively charged electron, it can be influenced by
electric and magnetic field. When it passes through matter, it can ionize the
molecule-atoms of the matter due to collision with them. Since the size of a beta
particle is much smaller than that of an alpha particle (helium nucleus), its
penetrating capability is more than the alpha particle and it can penetrate deeper
into matter. It is possible to stop a normal beta particle by a few millimeter thick
aluminum sheet.
