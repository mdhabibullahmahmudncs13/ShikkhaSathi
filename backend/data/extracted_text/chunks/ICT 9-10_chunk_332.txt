Changing the Positioning of Page By Hand Tool

If the size of the page is made smaller or bigger, the necessary part of the object

can go outside the visible area. In this case, to shift the object to a suitable place

on the screen

- Select the Hand Tool by clicking on it in the Hand Tool Box.

- Click on the necessary object with the Hand Tool, dragging it to a suitable
place, and release the pressure of the finger on the mouse.

In this way, the positioning of the original page can be changed. The object

that has been clicked will not be shifted in a different way.

Mode of Viewing Object

There are some modes to view objects in the Illustrator programme. Any of these

can be selected from the View menu as required.
