Chapter 16. Mensuration 341
Example 23. Diameter of a wheel is 4.5 metre. To traverse a distance of 360 metre,
how many times the wheel will revolve?
Solution: Given that, the diameter of the wheel is 4.5 metre.
4.5
.. The radius of the wheel, r = 5 = 2.25 metre and circumference = 277.
Let, for traversing 360 metre , the wheel will revolve n times.
As per question, n x 27r = 360
360 360
== = 25.4 .
On er x16 x 235 246 (approx)
.. The wheel will revolve 25 times. (approx.)
Example 24. Two wheels revolve 32 and 48 times respectively to cover a
distance of 211 metre 20cm. Determine the difference of their radii.
Solution: 211 metre 20 cm = 21120 cm
Let, the radii of two wheels are R and r respectively ; where R > r.
