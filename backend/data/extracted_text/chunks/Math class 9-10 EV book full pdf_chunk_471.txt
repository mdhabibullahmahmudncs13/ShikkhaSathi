========================================

determined geometrically.
Trigonometric ratios of the angles 30° and 60° :
Let, /ZXOZ = 30° and P is a point on OZ. Let ,
us draw PM L OX and extend PM to @Q so that »
MQ = PM. Add O, Q and extend to Z. d
Now for APOM and AQOM PM = QM ps
OM common side and included ZPMO = included =A ‘
o MX
ZQMO = 90° ~~
 APOM = AQOM
co ZQOM = ZPOM = 30° ]
and ZOQM = ZOPM = 60° ? ps
Again, ZPOQ = ZPOM+ZQOM = 30°+30° = 60°
-. AOPQ is an equilateral triangle.
IfOP =2a then PM = PQ = sop = a [since AOPQ is an equilateral triangle.]
Form the right-angled AOPM we get,
OM = OP? = PM? = \Jda* — a = \/3a
