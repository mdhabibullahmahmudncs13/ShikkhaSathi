========================================

(c) Express the temperature of air in Fahrenheit scale.

(d) Explain the cause for the wire to snap with mathematical logic.

2. The length of two metal rods is 6 m. If one rod is heated to increase its
temperature from 30°C to 80°C, its length becomes 6.0051 m after
extension. If another rod is heated to increase its temperature from 20°C to
60°C, its length becomes 6.0041 m after extension. The co-efficient of
linear expansion is a, the co-efficient of area expansion is PB and the
co-efficient of volume expansion is ¥.
