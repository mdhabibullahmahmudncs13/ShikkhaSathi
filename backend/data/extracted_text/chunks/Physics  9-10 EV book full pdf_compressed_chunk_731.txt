10.1 Charge

If you comb your hair in winter and then hold the comb near some small pieces
of paper, you will notice that the pieces jump towards the comb. In cold
countries during winter air is very dry. When babies crawl on carpet, their hair
seems to stand straight and it seems one hair is pushing the other. All of you have
seen thunder bolts during stormy night and observed how flashes of lightning
comes towards the earth.

In the attraction of paper, repulsion of hair or thunder bolt- the basic thing behind
these three phenomena is charge. To know what charge is and why charges
attract or repulse or create thunder bolts, we have to understand the basics, we
have to know how atoms and molecules are formed.
