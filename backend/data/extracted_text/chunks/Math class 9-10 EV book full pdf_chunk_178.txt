Solution: If the cost price is Tk. 100, the selling price at the loss of 2% is Tk.
= (100 — x)
If selling price is Tk. (100 — x), cost price is Tk. 100
A I - 100
If selling price is Tk. 1, cost price is Tk. 00-2
. Ces 100
Hence, the cost price of 10 sticks is Tk. ———
100 — x
100
.. The cost price of 1 stick is Tk. 00-2) x 10°
Again if the cost price is Tk. 100, selling price at the profit of 2% is Tk. (100 + 2)
If the cost price is Tk. 100, selling price is Tk. (100 + 2).
100
If the cost price is Tk. 1, selling price is Tk. =

. If the cost price is Tk. 0-2) x10 s
oo 100 + = 100 (100 + 2)
sell Tk, —— X=
selling price 1s 100 (100 — 2) x 10 (100 — 2) x 10
