========================================

u: initial velocity

a: acceleration

t: elapsed time

v: velocity after elapsed time

s: distance covered in elapsed timed
Almost all the relationship among these quantities, are done already, only one is
left, which is the relationship for the distances. If an object has no acceleration,
then there is no change in its velocity. Then the initial velocity and the final
velocity will be equal i.e.(u = v). Therefore the distance covered will be,

s=uvt
If there is uniform acceleration, the final velocity is:
v=u+at
