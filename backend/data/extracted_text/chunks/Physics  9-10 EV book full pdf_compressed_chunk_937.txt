========================================

Another important use of radioactivity is the determination of the age of
ancient fossils. In our body there is huge amount of carbon in which a
definite amount of C , is present. When an animal dies, no more C , can
enter the body further. The amount of carbon deposited before gets less due
to the half life. Thus knowing the amount of C , that would have normally
been present initially, and by calculating the amount which is decayed, age
can be determined accurately.

A radioactive element can cause harm to the cells of the body, so different
types of caution are taken. Radioactivity is used to destroy harmful cells
within the body. This is why, for the treatment of cancer radioactive
elements are used to destroy cancer cells.
