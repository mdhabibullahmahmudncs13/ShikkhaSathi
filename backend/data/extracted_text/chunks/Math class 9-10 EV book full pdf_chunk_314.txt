========================================

a result two adjacent angles ZAOC and ZCOB are D C
formed. Draw a perpendicular DO on AB.

Sum of the adjacent two angles

= AOC + ZC0B = ZAOD + /DOC + ZCOB

= ZAOD + ZDOB = 2 right angles. A 0 B
Theorem 2. When two straight lines intersect, the vertically opposite angles
are equal.

Let AB and C'D be two straight lines, which intersect A D

at O. As a result the angles ZAOC, ZCOB, ZBOD,

ZAOD are formed at O. %)

ZAOC = opposite ZBOD and ZCOB = opposite

ZAOD. (ol B
Parallel lines

Alternate angles, corresponding angles and interior angles of the
traversal
