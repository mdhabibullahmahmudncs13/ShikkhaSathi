3.9.2 Effects of friction on motion
We already discussed that the frictional force always acts opposite to the applied
force. Therefore, naturally the frictional force slows down the motion and it may
o be our assumption that perhaps we always try to reduce the friction. But that is
S not true. Sometimes you may have seen that a car or a truck is stuck in mud.
