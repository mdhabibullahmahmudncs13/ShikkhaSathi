Question: Suppose you are standing on a totally frictionless surface. Your mass
is 50 kg and there is a stone of mass 100 kg in front of you. You have decided
to push the stone with a force of 50 N and will move it from one end to the
other end. What will be the velocity of the stone after 10 s? (Figure 3.14)

Figure 3.14 : When a person pushes a stone, the stone also
pushes the person in return.
Answer: When you push the stone with a force of 50 N, then according to
Newton’s third law the stone will push you also with a force of 50 N. The
acceleration of the stone will take place to the right.

Your acceleration will be exactly towards left,
