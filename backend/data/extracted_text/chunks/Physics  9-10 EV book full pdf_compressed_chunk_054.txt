Electric current
In this universe anything we can measure is called a quantity. In this physical
world there are innumerable quantities which can be measured. For example, we
can name, length, breadth, volume, weight, temperature, colour, rigidity,
position, velocity, internal material, electrical conductivity, non-conductivity,
elasticity, heat conductivity, non-conductivity, density, specific heat, pressure,
melting point, etc, and we cannot finish this list. In brief, in the physical world
the quantities are endless. You may think that to measure these infinite number
of quantities, we have to prepare the definitions and units for these infinite
