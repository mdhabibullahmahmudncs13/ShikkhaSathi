========================================

I shall never forget it. A day may come, who knows, when | may do you a good
turn to repay your kindness.” The lion smiling at his little prisoner's fright and
amused by the thought that so small a creature ever could be of assistance to
the king of beasts, let him go.
Not long afterward the lion, while ranging the forest for his prey, was caught in
the net which the hunters had set to catch him. He let out a roar that echoed
through the forest. Even the mouse heard it, and recognizing the voice of his
former preserver and friend, ran to the spot where he lay tangled in the net of
ropes.
