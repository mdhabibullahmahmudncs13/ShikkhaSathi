reflecting, it will become parallel to Rg, Figure 8.23: The image becomes inverted if
as after reflection in the concave mirror object is placed outside focal length of a

point, the reverse is also true. Light always follows its path in reverse direction. Lines
QF and RS intersect at the point X’ and point X" is the image of point X.
So, the normal drawn on line PO

fn) X'Y" is the image of object XY. This
N= image is unique compared to other
BH images. This is shown in Figure 8.24.
