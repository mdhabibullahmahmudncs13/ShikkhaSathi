========================================

In fact, we don’t need such type of complexities; for our purpose, we can
consider any point as the origin, which seems stationary to us. In this case we
have to mention all the measurements are done with respect to this origin. In this
way scientists have done all the measurements starting from the nucleus of an
atom to the satellites launched in space, with no problems what so ever!

2.2 Different Types of Motion

We see various types of motions around us, vibrations, rotations and separations
— all these are the examples of different kinds of motions. Probable motions are
unlimited, but if we wish, we can talk about some important types of motion
separately.

Linear motion
