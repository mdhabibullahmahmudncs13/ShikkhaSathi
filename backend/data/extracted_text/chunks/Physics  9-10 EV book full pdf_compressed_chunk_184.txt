We discussed the motion of objects in earlier chapters but the reason behind
motion was not discussed. In this chapter we will see that motion is created due
to force and will also discuss about three devises laws of Isaac Newton regarding
force. At the time of discussion of how force acts on a body, very naturally topics
like different types of force, inertia of body, nature of force, frictional force etc
come into the discussion.
