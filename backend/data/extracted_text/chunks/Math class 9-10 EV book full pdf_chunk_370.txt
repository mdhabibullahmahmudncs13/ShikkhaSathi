Sometimes special quadrilaterals can be constructed with fewer data. In such a
case, from the properties of quadrilaterals, we can retrieve five necessary data.
For example, a parallelogram can be constructed if only the two adjacent sides
and the included angle are given. In this case, only three data are given. Again,
a square can be constructed when only one side of the square is given. The four
sides of a square are equal and an angle is a right angle; so five data are easily
specified.
