You have seen from the above examples that actually the value of the co-
efficient of expansion of solids is very small. For this reason, the three different
co-efficients a, p and ¥ were not necessary. For working we could explain the
co-efficient of linear expansion only. For example let us assume the matter of
area expansion.
We see:
Ay = Ay + BAT, — T1)
But area 4 is the product of length and width and if we consider the area of a
square whose length is L , then its area, after increasing the temperature, will be
A; = 13 = [Ly + aly (T, = TD]?
Or Ap = 13 + 20L3(T, = Ty) + o2L3(T, = Ty)?
But A, =13
So, Ay = Ay + 204,(T, — Ty) + 0A, (T, — T;)?
