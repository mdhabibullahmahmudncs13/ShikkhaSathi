consumed
VI. Every house has an electric meters. It continuously measures potential
(¥) and what amount of current is flowing (7). From there it can determine how
much electrical energy (P=VI) is provided in each second in the house.
Multiplying this with the total time we can find the total electrical energy spent.
The conventional unit of electrical energy spent is kilowatt-hour (kW-h). This
unit is called Board of Trade Unit (BOT) or briefly, Unit. The electric bill we pay
is calculated in this unit.
Example
Question: What is the resistance of the filament of a 100 W bulb?
Answer: 100W is written on a 220V bulb, as
