Acute angle and obtuse angle B c
An angle which is less than a right angle is called an /
acute angle and an angle greater than one right angle
but less than two right angles is an obtuse angle. In
the figure, ZAOC' is an acute angle and ZAOD is an 0 =
obtuse angle. Here ZAOB is a right angle.
Reflex angle JL
An angle which is greater than two right angles and
. 0 A
less than four right angles is called a reflex angle. In p
the figure, ZAOC' is a reflex angle. c
Complementary angle
If the sum of two angles is one right angle, the two
angles are called complementary angles. A Cc
In the adjacent figure, ZAOB is a right angle. The
ray OC is in the inner side of the angle and makes
two angles ZAOC and ZC'OB.So taking together the
