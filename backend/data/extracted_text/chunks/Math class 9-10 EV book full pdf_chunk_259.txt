========================================

ie,ab=0,a=0o0r,b=0, or, both a=0and b=0.

Example 8. Solve: (z+ 2)(z —3)=0

Solution: (z+ 2)(z —3)=0

cr+2=0o0rnx—-3=0

Ifer4+2=02=-2

Again, if rt —3=0,2=3

solution is z = —2 or, x = 3

Example 9. Find the solution set: y* = v/3y

Solution: y? = v/3y

or, y= V3y =0 [ by transposition, right hand side has been done zero]

or, yly = v3) =0

Sy=00ry—+v3=0 N

3
Again, if y —v/3=10,y=3 g
