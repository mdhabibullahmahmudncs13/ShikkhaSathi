========================================

- The Resolution, for example, 72 Pixel, is kept unchanged.
Images or pictures are created in Photoshop by pixels. Pixel is the smallest
square unit of image. 72 pixels per inch mean crossing 72 lines vertically and
horizontally in per inch space. The total number of pixels in one square inch
will be 72'72= 5184. The number of pixels in per square inch is called
resolution. If 130 is typed in the box of pixel, the resolution will be
130°130=16900. If an image is enlarged, the pixels could be visible. This view
is called pixelated. In simple words, it is called split image.
