is is shown in Figure 12.05. You are able to understand that the more the
current, the stronger the magnetic field is. There is a limit to how much current
can be pass through a wire, since the wire is heated as I°R. Moreover, the
maximum amount of current that can pass through a wire depends on the source
of electricity. Therefore if we want to produce a strong magnetic field, then
instead of making a single loop, a coil is made by a insulated wire, winding it =~ §

several times. This coil is called a solenoid. A strong magnetic field can be
