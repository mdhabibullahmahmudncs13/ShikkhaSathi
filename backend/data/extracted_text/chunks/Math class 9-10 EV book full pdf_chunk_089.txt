ANB = {36}
The required set is {36}
Example 14. Of 100 students 88 passed in Bangla, 80 in Mathematics and 70
in both subjects. Express the information in Venn diagram, and find how many
students failed in both subjects.
(oe)
F
Solution: In the Venn diagram rectangular area represents U the set of 100
students. The set of students who passed in Bangla and Mathematics are denoted
respectively by B and M. As a result the Venn diagram is divided into 4 disjoint,
sets denoted by P,Q, R and F.
Here, the set of students passed in both subjects is Q = B NM, cardinality of
which is 70.
P is the set of students passed in Bangla only. Its cardinality is |P| = 88 —70 =18.
R is the set of students who passed only in Mathmatics. .. |R| =80—70=10
