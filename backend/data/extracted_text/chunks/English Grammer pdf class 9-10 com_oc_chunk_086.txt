42 English Grammar and Composition
Grammar point
We use verbs which describe an action or situation in the present continuous
to talk about something happening now:
Iam listening to music. Amir is playing in the garden. Mom is cooking
dinner.
Verbs not used in the continuous:
We don’t use the present continuous with verbs which we use to describe
people or things:
Amina is at school. (NOT Amina is being at school.)
1 like this painting. (NOT I'm liking this painting.)
But | don’t understand it. (NOT But | am not understanding it.)
Do you love him? (NOT Are you loving him?)
Verbs which are not usually used in the continuous form fall under the
categories of sense verbs, state verbs, emotion verbs, possession verbs and
other.
