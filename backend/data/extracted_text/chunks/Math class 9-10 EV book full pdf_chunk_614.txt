Chapter 12. Simple Simultaneous Equations in Two Variables 265
2) from equation (2) we get, 2x + 2y = 100

or, 2 + x + 10 = 100 [putting the value of 2y from (1)]

or, 3x = 90

or, x = 30

from (1) we get, 2y = 30 + 10 [putting the value of x]

or, 2y = 40

or, y = 20

length of the garden is 30 metre and breadth is 20 metre.

3) Length of the garden with the path = (30 + 4)

m. = 34 m.

and breadth of the garden with the path =

(20 +4) m. =24 m.

. Area of the path= Area of the garden with iy 8 2

the path - Area of the garden 2°

30m
2m

= (34 x 24 — 30 x 20) square metre. Tam

= (816 — 600) square metre.

= 216 square metre.
