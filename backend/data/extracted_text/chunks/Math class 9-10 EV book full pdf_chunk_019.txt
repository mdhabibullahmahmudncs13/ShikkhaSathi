Chapter 1. Real Numbers 5
5. If ais real number, (i) a + (—a) =0 (ii) If a # 0 then a - 1 1
6. If a,b,c are real numbers, a(b+ ¢) = ab + ac ‘
7. If a,b are real numbers,a <bora=bora>b
8. If a,b,c are real numbers and a < b,then a +c <b+¢
9. If a,b ¢ are real numbers and a < b, then (i) ac < be whenever ¢ > 0
(i1) ac > be whenever ¢ < 0
Proposition: V2 is an irrational number.
Proof: Suppose, v/2 is an irrational number.
Then there are two mutually prime numbers p, ¢ > 1 so that v2 = 2 .
7 . . » a. ) !
Or, 2 = Zz [squaring] that is 2¢ = n [multiplying both sides by ¢ |
Obviously 2¢ is an integer but v is not an integer, because p and ¢ are natural
numbers and they are mutually Trime and ¢ > 1.
2g and z cannot be equal, that is 2¢ # Z
