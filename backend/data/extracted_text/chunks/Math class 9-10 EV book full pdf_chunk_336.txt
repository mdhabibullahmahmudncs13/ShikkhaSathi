Theorem 12. If one angle of a triangle is greater than another, the side opposite
the greater angle is greater than the side opposite the lesser.
A
Special Nomination: Let, in triangle AABC,
ZABC > ZACB Tt is to be proved that, AC > AB / ~
B [S
Proof:
Step 1. If the side AC is not greater than AB, then (i) AC = AB
or, (12) AC < AB.
(i) If AC = AB, then ZABC = LACB [. The base angles of isosceles
triangle are equal]
Which is against the supposition, since by supposition ZABC > ZACB.
(i1) Again, if AC' < AB, then ZABC < ZACB. ['.- The angle opposite
to smaller side is smaller]
But this is also against the supposition.
Step 2. Therefore, the side AC is neither equal to nor less than AB.
AC > AB (Proved).
