========================================

quantity of the second ratio. That is, those quantities are to be made equal to
their L.C.M.
Here, L.C.M of 3 and 4 is 12.
,_ 2 2x4 8
Here, 2:3 =o = 0-7 =15=8:12
4 4x3 12
Again, 4:3 =-=——="—-=12:
gain, 4:3 33x3-9 9
Therefore, if the ratios 2 : 3 and 4 : 3 are expressed in the form, a : b : ¢ will be
8§:12:9
It is to be noted that if the earning of Sami in the above example is 1125, the
ratio of their earnings will be 8 : 12: 9.
Example 12. If a,b, ¢ are quantities of same kind and a : b=3:4,b:¢=6:7,
what will be a: b: ¢?
3 3x3 9 6 6x2 12
