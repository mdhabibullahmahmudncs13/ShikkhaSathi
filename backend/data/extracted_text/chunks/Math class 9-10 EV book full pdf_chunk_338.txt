Chapter 6. Lines, Angles and Triangles 139
Theorem 14. The line segment joining the mid-points of any two sides of a
triangle is parallel to the third side and in length it is half.
Special Nomination: Let ABC be a triangle. D
and FE are respectively mid-points of the AB and AC. A

It is required to prove DE || BC and DE = 5BC- D, E F
Drawing: Join D and E and extend to I" so that
EF = DE. Draw a straight line segment from C' to F'. B c
Proof:
Step 1. Between AADE and ACEF, AE = EC [given]

DE = EF [by construction]

LAED = /CEF [opposite angles]

o.AADE = ACEF [SAS theorem]

SLADE = ZEFC [alternate angle]

SAD || CF

Again, BD = AD = CF and BD || CF

Therefore BDF C' is a parallelogram.

DF || BC or, DE || BC.
Step 2. Again, DF = BC or, DE + EF = BC'
