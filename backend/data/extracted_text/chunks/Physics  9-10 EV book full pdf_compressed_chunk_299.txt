========================================

Doing positive work — giving energy to the object.
Doing negative work — taking away energy from the object.
You can clearly understand that energy has no direction and it is a scalar
quantity. As we produce energy by doing work or do work spending energy,
these two have the same unit and the same dimension.
Unit of energy: J (Joule)
Dimension of energy [W] = ML2T 2

Example

Q J
Question: You have moved an object 10 m by applying a force of 100 N on it.
If the frictional force is 10 N in the opposite direction, then what is the amount
of work done by you? What is the amount of work done by the frictional force? 8
