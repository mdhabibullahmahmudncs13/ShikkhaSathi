Proof: Let, log,M =z, log,N =y
So M=a", N=a¥
Now, MN =a" -a¥ = a"
clog (MN) =a +y
or, log, (MN) = log,M + log,N [putting the values of x,y]
dog, (MN) = log, M + log, N (proved)
Note: log, (MNP...) =log,M +log,N + log,P +...
Note: log, (M + N) # log, M + log, N
Formula 8 (log of quotient). tog, AF = log, M — log, N
Proof: Let, log,M =z, log, N =y
M=a", N=a
Now, ud = Z =a?
CL log, =zr—y
N
so log, 57 = log, M — log, N (proved)
Formula 9 (Log of power). log, M" = rlog, M
Proof: Let, log, M =x, -.M =a”
or, (M)" = (a*)" or, M" =a"
clog, MT = ra or, log, M" = r log, M
log, M” = rlog,M (proved)
Note: (log, M)" and rlog,M may not be equal.
For example, (log,4)” = (log,2%)° = 2° = 32, log, = 5-2 = 10 # 32
