========================================

path. So, the higher the cross sectional area 4 of a conductor, the lower is the
resistance.
R x 1
A
If we want to write these two things as an equation rather than in proportional
form, a constant p has to be used. So, resistance R is,
R= L
=p
. A
Where the constant p is, p=R I
