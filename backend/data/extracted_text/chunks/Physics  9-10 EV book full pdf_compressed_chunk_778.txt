========================================

with very fine powder like ink, and black ink is absorbed at the parts of the roller

where charges are formed. Then this ink is imprinted on a new white page. The

ink is attached very well to the paper by heating so that the ink doesn't scatter,

and the process work in this way.

10.8.2 Van de Graaff Machine

Different types of work are done with high voltage. This can be done with a Van

de Graaff machine using static electricity. Static charges are sprayed on a

rotating insulating belt, by rotating the

belt it is taken inside a metallic sphere IP slit ty

(Figure 10.17). A tangent (comb of + +

sharp needle) receives the charge from Thy tangent We

above the belt and sends it to the + Za +20 +

metallic sphere. We know, charge + (Q=27)) +

always flows from higher potential to + +
