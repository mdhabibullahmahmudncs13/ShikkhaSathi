Take two balloons, put a small amount of water into one of them and air of
the same volume in another one. Now put the two balloons under hot water
for a small interval of time. You will notice that the balloon containing water
remains the same, because the expansion of liquid due to heat is smaller but
the balloons containing air has expanded in volume to a large extent,
because the expansion of gas is much more higher than that of liquid.
6.4 Effect of Temperature in Change of State
Already you have know that all solids consist of molecules and in solids
molecules attract one another from a certain position. If heat is applied, their
vibrations increase and the molecular bonds become weak. They start to move
