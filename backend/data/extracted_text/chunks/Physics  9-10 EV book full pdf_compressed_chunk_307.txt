========================================

(c) If force is applied for 20 s, then the velocity is,
v=at=1m/s?x20s=20m/s
Therefore the kinetic energy,
! 2110x202 = 2000
smu? = J = 2000]
Question: Motion is created in a body of mass 10 kg by applying a force, if its
kinetic energy becomes 80 J, what is its velocity?
Answer: Kinetic energy is,
1
Fm? =80]
