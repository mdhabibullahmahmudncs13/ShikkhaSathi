numbers in our daily life. But in electronics numbers are expressed by binary
numbers, because they can be easily processed (voltage as 1 and zero voltage as
0). The number system expressed with the digits ‘0’ and ‘1° is a binary number
system. (Figure. 13.04)
The greatest contribution of electronics is the computer. The exchange of all data
or processing of all data in a computer is processed by digital electronics. Digital
electronics is also used in the internet and computer networks to exchange data.
Sound, image or video etc. start as analog signals (and is used as analog signal
too) but they are stored, processed and sent as digital signal. Noise can spoil the
quantity of analog signals very easily by entering the signals. Once it is
