========================================

angles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the
two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the sum of
angles is less than two right angles.
After Euclid stated his postulates and axioms, he used them to prove other results.
Then using these results, he proved some more results by applying deductive
reasoning. The statements that were proved are called propositions or theorems.
Euclid is his ‘elements’ proved a total of 465 propositions in a logical chain. This
is the foundation of modern geometry.
Note that there are some incompleteness in Euclid’s first postulate. The drawing
of a unique straight line passing through two distinct points has been ignored.
