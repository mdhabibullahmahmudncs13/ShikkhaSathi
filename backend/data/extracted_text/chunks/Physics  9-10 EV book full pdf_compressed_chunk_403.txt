========================================

Py = hipg
and the upward pressure acting on lower surface is:

Py =hypg
Therefore, the downward force acting on upper surface and upward force acting
on lower surface are respectively:

Fy, = AP, = Ah, pg
F, = AP, = Ah, pg

We do not have to think about how much force is exerted on the surrounding
surface, because the force experienced by the cylinder from one direction is
equal and opposite to the force from another direction and neutralize one anoth-
er.

As the value of 4, is greater than %,, so we see the value of F), is greater than
F,.
Therefore the resultant force will be upwards and its value will be:
F=F,—F =A; —h)pg
F = Ahpg
