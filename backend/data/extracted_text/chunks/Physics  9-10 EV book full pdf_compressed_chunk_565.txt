========================================

determine time period, frequency or to position
velocity from the information that are
given in the figure! The wave shown above is the condition of the wave at a
particular time. Here there is no information how the position changes with time.
Question: In figure 7.07 another wave is shown. Among the wave’s amplitude,
wavelength, time period, frequency and velocity which magnitude can be
determined from this figure? Determine them.
02 The amplitude (0.2 m) and time
6 period (2 s) of this wave can be
= determined; from this figure other
2} 0 . . .
E information cannot be determined.
E] How the wave changes with time at
&- 02 a particular position is shown in the
= 1 2 3 4 figure. So, it is not possible to
time (s) determine the wavelength.
