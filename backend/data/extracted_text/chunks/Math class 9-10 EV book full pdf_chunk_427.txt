========================================

Let the two circles with centres at A and B touch

cach other externally at O. It is required to prove r

that the points A, O, B are collinear.

Drawing: Since the given circles touch each other

at O,they have a common tangent at the point O.

Now draw the common tangent POQ at O and join 0

O,A and O, B.

Proof:

In the circles with the centre A, OA is the radius through the point of contact of

the tangent and POQ is the tangent.

Therefore ZPOA = 1 right angle. Similarly ZPOB = 1 right angle.

ZPOA + ZPOB = 1 right angle + 1 right angle = 2 right angles

Or, ZAOB = 2 right angles

i.e. ZAOB is a straight angle.

oA, O, Bare collinear. (Proved)

Corollary 11. If two circles touch each other externally, the distance between

their centres is equal to the sum of their radii
