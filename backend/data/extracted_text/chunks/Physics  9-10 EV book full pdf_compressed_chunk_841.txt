========================================

circuit) then the equivalent resistance will be:
R=R, +Ry+Rs+..+R,
11.2.5 Equivalent resistance: Parallel circuit
Now we will place the resistances in parallel instead of one after another (Figure
11.13). In this circuit we have named different points as A, B,C, DD, E and
F. We can understand from the figure that points D, E and F are connected to the
ground and so their potentials are zero. So the potential of points A, B,and Cis
