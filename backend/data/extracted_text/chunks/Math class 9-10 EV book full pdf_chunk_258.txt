========================================

equation. The equation, which has the highest

degree 2 of the variable, is called the quadratic

equation.

In class VIII, we have factorized the quadratic expressions inone variable of

the forms 2% + pa + ¢ and ax? + bx + c. Here, we shall solve the equations of the

forms 2° + pz + ¢ = 0 and az? + bx + ¢ = 0 by factorizing the left hand side and

by finding the value of the variable.

An important law of real numbers is applied to the method of factorization. The

law is as follows :

If the product of two quantities is equal to zero, either only one of the quantities

or both quantities will be zero. That is, if the product of two quantities a and b

ie,ab=0,a=0o0r,b=0, or, both a=0and b=0.

Example 8. Solve: (z+ 2)(z —3)=0

Solution: (z+ 2)(z —3)=0

cr+2=0o0rnx—-3=0
