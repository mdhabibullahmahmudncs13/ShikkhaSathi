========================================

3 km 3x 1000 m

Therefore, = = =

V= ZO minutes © 20x 605 20 M/S
In this example you have noticed that the value of the average velocity is less
than that of the average speed. If the path was straight rather than curved, then
the magnitude of the average velocity would be equal to the magnitude of the
average speed.

In our example, if you rode your cycle always at the same speed then we say
your speed is uniform speed. When anything moves with uniform speed then its
instantaneous speed and average speed will be the same.
