========================================

Example

Question: The half life of a radioactive element of 1 kg is 100 years. What will be

its mass after 200 years?

Answer: Mass does not change directly due to radioactivity. Only three fourth

of the nuclei of the radioactive element will emit radioactive particles in 200

years.

13.1.5 Uses of Radioactivity

There are many different uses of Radioactivity. If a small amount of
radioactive sample is inserted into the body, information about the body
can be detected by observing the movement of the radioactive sample from
outside the body. Generally those radioactivity samples have a very low
half life, it may a few minutes, thus the radioactivity of the samples will be
finished within an hour.
