Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 31
The above set of ordered pairs is called Cartesian Product set.
In set building method, A x B = {(2,y) : x € Aand y € B}
A x Bis read as A cross B.
Example 12. If P = {1,2,3}, @ = {3,4}, R = PN Q,then determine P x R
and R x Q.
Solution: Given, P = {1,2,3}, Q = {3,4}
and R=PNQ={1,2,3} N{3,4} = {3}
SPX R= {12,3} x {3} = {(1,3).(2,3),(3.3)}
and Bx Q = {3} x {3.4} = {(3.3), (3.4)}

1) If (3 + 3 1) (r 3 + 2) then determine (x,y).
2) If P=1{1,2,3}, Q = {3,4} and R = {z,y},then determine (PUQ) x R
and (PNQ) x Q.
Example 13. Determine the set of natural numbers that have the same residue
23 when they divide 311 and 419.
Solution: The natural numbers that leave 23 as residue when they divide 311
