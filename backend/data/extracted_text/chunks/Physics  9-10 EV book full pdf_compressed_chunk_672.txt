========================================

have imagined a normal from the Figure 9.01 : Refraction of light from
point of incident. We do the same first medium to the second
here . In Figure 9.01 we will call the
angle between the incident ray and the normal as the angle of incidence and the
angle between the refracted ray and the normal as angle of refraction.
First Law of Refraction: The refracted ray will lie on the same plane as the
incident ray and the normal.
Second Law of Refraction: If the refractive index of the first medium is n ,
the refractive index of the second medium is n,, the angle of incidence is 0, ,
the angle of refraction is 6,, then
ni sinbh = ny sin 6;
If you remember this, you will be able to solve all problems about
refraction of light.
