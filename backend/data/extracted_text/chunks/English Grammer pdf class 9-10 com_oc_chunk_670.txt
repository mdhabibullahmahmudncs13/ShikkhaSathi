========================================

Depending on the level of the learners, items will be set to test learners’ lower order
thinking skills (knowing and understanding) as well as higher order and more critical
thinking (analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating). Use synonyms in the questions to
avoid quoting directly from the original passage. Make the questions a bit round about
so that learners think.
For example :
Text : The Great Wall of China, one of the greatest wonders of the world, was first
built between 220-206 BC.
Question : When was the Great Wall first built? (Don't make this type of question.
Student will just get the answer from the question paper as 'was born’ is common in
both the text in the question paper and the answer.)
