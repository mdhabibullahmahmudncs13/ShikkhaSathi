You have likely noticed various warnings on electric lines, such as "Danger: Ten
Thousand Volts." Electric shock is a serious and potentially life-threatening
hazard; there have been many instances where careless individuals have lost
their lives due to electric shocks. If you grasp the concept of electrical potential,
you can better understand what occurs in these situations. When you encounter a
