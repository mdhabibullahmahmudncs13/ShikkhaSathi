========================================

of vibration is the same. The velocity of
sound depends on the property of the medium. In gaseous mediums its velocity
is low, in liquids greater, and in solids it is much more. The velocity of sounds
depends on the temperature and humidity of the medium. The intensity of sound
is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave. Therefore, if the
amplitude of a wave is high, the intensity of the sound will be high and if the
amplitude is low, the intensity will be low.
@ Do Yourself:
Take two plastic glasses. Make two small holes on the bottom of the glasses
with a hot safety pin. Put thread through this hole and tie the thread inside
the cup (Figure 7.12). Tie the two plastic glasses with long thread. One
