========================================

2) Given system of equations is:
z+3y=1
. i 2
Ratio of the coefficients of = is 1
-5
Ratio of the coefficients of x is 3
2, 5
We get, — # —
get, 7 #
.. Therefore, the system of equations is consistent and mutually independent.
The system of equations has only one (unique) solution.
