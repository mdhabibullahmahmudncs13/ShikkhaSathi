Chapter 8. Circle 183
Proof: B,0 and C,O are joined. The point O stands on EM, the perpendicular
bisector of AB.
.OA = OB, Similarly, OA = OC
OA=0B=0C
Hence, the circle drawn with O as the centre and OA as the radius passes through
the three points A, B and C'. This circle is the required circumcircle of AABC.
Work: In the above figure, the circumcircle of an acute angled-triangle is
constructed. Construct the circumcircle of an obtuse and right-angled
triangles.
Notice that for in obtuse-angled triangle, the circumcentre lies outside the
triangle, in acute-angled triangle, the circumcentre lies within the triangle and in
right-angled triangle, the circumcentre lies on the hypotenuse of the triangle.
Construction 10. To draw a circle inscribed in a triangle.
