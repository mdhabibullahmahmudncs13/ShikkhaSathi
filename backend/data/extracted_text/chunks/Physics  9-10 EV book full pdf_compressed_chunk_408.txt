Question: If a piece of wood floats on water what percent of it will be
immersed? (Density of wood p= 0.5x10%kg/m* density of water
Py = 10° kg/m?)
Answer: In order to float, the weight of the wood must be equal to the mass of the
water displaced by the immersed part of the wood. That is, if volume of wood is
V then its mass will be Vp, and if the volume of the immersed part of the wood
is Vy, the mass of that amount of water is Vp,
Therefore, Vp=Vyp,
Vi pp 05x10%kg/m?
—=—=——""" x 100 = 509

Question: A piece of wood of mass 10 kg went to sea floating from the river. In
the river water it was half immersed, how much of it will immerse in the sea?
(Density of sea water, 25 = 1.03 x 10%kg/m?)
