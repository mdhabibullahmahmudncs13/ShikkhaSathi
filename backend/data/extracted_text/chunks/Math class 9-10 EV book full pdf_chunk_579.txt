========================================

coefficients of the same variable become equal. Then as per need, if the
equations are added or subtracted, the variable with equal coefficient will be
eliminated. Then, solving the obtained equation, the value of the existing
variable will be found. If that value is put conveniently in any of the given
equations, value of the other variable will be found.
Cross multiplication method:
We consider the following two equations:
mr +by+e=0...(1)
arr + boy + ca =0...(2)
Multiplying equation (1) by by and equation (2) by b; we get,
arbor + bibay + bac; = 0... (3)
ashy + biboy + byes = 0... (4)
