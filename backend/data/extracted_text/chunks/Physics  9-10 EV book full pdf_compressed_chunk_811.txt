========================================

electron is positive charge. So increasing the deficiency by moving electrons
means a supply of positive charge! So, if it is said that in Figure 11.01 positive
charge moves from A to B by flow of electricity, actually it means that electrons
move from B to A.
The flow of charge is electric current. So far, we have tried to understand it
normally. Let us specify it a little bit now. Electric current means the rate of
change of flow of charge with respect to time i.e. if OQ charge flows in time t, the
electric current is:
I= Q
t
