Force 67
Force of gravitation is an amazing force of physics. An object that has mass
attracts another object by the gravitational force. In this chapter, we shall discuss
the gravitational force a little bit more in detail.
3.2.2 Electromagnetic Force
We have seen, now and then, that when we comb our hair with a comb it attracts
pieces of papers. We have also seen that a magnet attracts or repulses another
magnet. Though we think that electric and magnetic forces are different in
nature, actually the two forces are identical. They only appear in two forms.
Only and this electromagnetic force can attract and repulse but the other forces
can attract only, cannot repulse. It is so much stronger than gravitational force
