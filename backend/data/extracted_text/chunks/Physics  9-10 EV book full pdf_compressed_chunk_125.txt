========================================

and point B is 4 km. Distance is a scalar ~~ / Js
quantity, so to express the distance Sh J
between the points A and B we need not fz

mention any direction. We determined pa J

the ‘distance’ of the point B along this a

path with respect to the point A. Now if [

we desire, we can determine the 1"

‘displacement’ of point B with respect

to point A. By displacement the position gure 2:04 : Curved path trakelled by
of point B with respect to point A is a cycle from point A.

meant. This can be expressed as AB as well.
