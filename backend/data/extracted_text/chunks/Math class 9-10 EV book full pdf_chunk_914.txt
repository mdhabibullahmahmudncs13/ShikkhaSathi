========================================

Proposition: : Let the diagonals AC and D Cc
BD of the rectangle ABCD intersect at O.
It is required to prove that,
(i) AC = BD
(ii) 40 =CO, BO=DO.
a= B
Proof:
Justification
(1) A rectangle is also a parallelogram. [Diagonals of a parallelogram
Therefore, 40 =CO, BO=DO. bisect each other]
(2) Now between AABD and AACD,
AB=DC [ Opposite sides of a
and AD = AD. parallelogram are equal ]
/DAB = /ADC [ each angle is a right angle]
Therefore, AABD =AACD. [ ASA theorem]
Therefore, AC =BD (Proved)
Activity : 1. Prove that every angle of a rectangle is the right angle. ES
