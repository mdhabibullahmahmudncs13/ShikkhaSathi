Current Electricity 325
In the figure, current is supplied to the lights and fan from the 5A circuit breaker.
15A is connected with cooking burner. 30A circuit breaker is connected to the
plug points of the house. We have certainly noticed that this part is like a ring
which means flow of current can be through two different paths. In this part the
ground is shown differently (green color).

What steps should be taken to minimize the dissipation of electricity?
Describe these in a nice poster.
