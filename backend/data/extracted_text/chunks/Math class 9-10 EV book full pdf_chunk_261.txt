110 Mathematics Classes IX-X
or, x = 3a
Again, when y = 3,
T+a 3
r—a 1
or, z+ a=3(x—a) [by cross-multiplication]
or, x +a=3r—3a
or, 3x —x = a+ 3a
or, z= 2a
.~. Solution is x = 2a or, r = 3a
‘Work:
1) Comparing the equation z*> — 1 = 0 with ax? + bx + ¢ = 0, write down
the values of a,b, c.
2) What is the degree of the equation (x — 1)>? How many roots does it
have and what are these?
Usage of quadratic equations
Many problems of our daily life can be solved easily by forming linear and
quadratic equations. Here, the formation of quadratic equations from the given
conditions based on real life problems and techniques for solving them are
discussed.
Example 12. Denominator of a proper fraction is 4 more than the numerator.
