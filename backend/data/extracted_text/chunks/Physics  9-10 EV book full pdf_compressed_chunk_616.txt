Take three pieces of glass of similar size (you can find this from photo-frame'
stores). Form a triangular shape with these three pieces and wrap them with
paper. Stick them in a triangular shape with glue as shown in Figure 8.11.
Cover one side with thin paper. Now put some colorful stones or colored
beads or pieces of bangles inside it and look from the other side. You will see
some beautiful patterns. This setup is called a kaleidoscope. If you rotate this
instrument, you will see the patterns in movement. Continuous reflections on
the glass create this pattern. You may think that in normal transparent glass
the reflection is less, but in a kaleidoscope the incident angle is larger,
therefore the amount of reflection is also higher.
