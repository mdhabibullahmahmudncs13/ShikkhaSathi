b Once a crow stole a piece of bread and fled with it to a tree a fox
seeing her and wishing to get the bread for himself tried to
obtain it by flattery what a beautiful bird you are he exclaimed
your voice is very sweet and you deserve to be called the queen
of birds hearing the voice the crow was highly pleased and
opened her mouth to caw as she opened its mouth the piece of
bread dropped from its mouth the fox quickly picked it up and
went away
