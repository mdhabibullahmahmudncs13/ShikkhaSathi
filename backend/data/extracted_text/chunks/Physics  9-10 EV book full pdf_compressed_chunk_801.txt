========================================

potentials will become equal due to flow of charge.
So you can understand that if we want a continuous flow of electricity, we
need some other process which will maintain a potential difference that
will not decrease with the flow of charges. All of you have seen such
5 technique; these are battery cells or generators. Potential difference is
