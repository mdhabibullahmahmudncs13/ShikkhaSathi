Verbs : Modals 93
We should find a place to eat now.
Or for the future:
He should/ought to go to a doctor.
We make the negative by adding not /n’t :
If you want to lose weight, you shouldn't eat so much chocolate.
And you ought not to eat junk or oily food.
We don’t usually use ought to in questions. We make questions with
should + subject + verb
e.g. Has Zaman sent the reports? | need them today.
I don’t think he has. Should | send him a mail or should { call
him?
Or, Shouldn't he consult a doctor before that?
Use
We often use should or ought to when we are giving advice:
You've had that cough for quite some time. You should/ought to see a
doctor.
We use should or ought to for expressing an opinion:
It’s a good book. You should/ought to read it. (| think)
