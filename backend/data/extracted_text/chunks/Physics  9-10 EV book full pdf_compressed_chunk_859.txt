========================================

(¢) Humidity: Water is conductor of electricity, so if water enters any circuit, it
may be dangerous due to short circuit. A hair drier or electric iron is very
dangerous to use near water, because if it falls suddenly in the water and anyone
touches it, an accident may occur by electrocuting the person.

(d) Circuit breaker and fuse: Major accidents of electricity occur when a
large amount of current flows suddenly due to some defects. To stop sudden
large flows, circuit breakers or fuses are used. A circuit breaker is made in such
away that if a large amount of current flows (more than the safer level), it breaks
the circuit. A fuse is a comparatively simple method; the amount of current that ~~ §
