Here, n = 70 and Z = 2 or 35
Therefore, median is the value of 35th term. 35th term lies in the class
(48-53). Hence the median class is (48-53).
cS L=48,F.=31,f,=25 and h=6
So median = 48 + (35 — 31) x = =48+4 x > = 48 + 0.96 = 48.96
J ia)
Required median 48.96.

3) The table useful to draw the frequency polygon is given below: The median
of the class prior to the first class would be 26.5 and the median of the class
following the last class would be 68.5.
