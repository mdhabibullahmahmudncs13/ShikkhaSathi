========================================

There is also an alcohol thermometer except mercury thermometer in which
alcohol is the thermometric substance and the expansion of alcohol is the
thermometric property. In a gas thermometer, gas is the thermometric substance
and the pressure of the gas at constant volume is the thermometric property. As
the resistance of metal changes with temperature, so the resistance also is used
as the thermometric property. Different thermometric substances are effective at
different temperatures, so to measure the very high or very low temperature the
special thermometric property of a special thermometric substance has to be
used. Copper and Constantan metals are used as thermometric substances. If two
junctions of different metals (thermocouple) are kept at different temperatures,
