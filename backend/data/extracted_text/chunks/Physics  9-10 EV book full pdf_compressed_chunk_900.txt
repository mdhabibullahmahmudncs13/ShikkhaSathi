========================================

flow through the coil. Only by moving the coil, the magnetic field is changed,
then a current will flow through it.
12.3.1 Generator
When we were trying to understand how a motor works, we saw that a current
passes through an electromagnet in a magnetic field which cause it to rotate. Let
us see the matter in another way. If instead of giving connection of a battery cell
with two terminals of an electromagnet of a motor, we connect an ammeter there
and rotate the electromagnet. What will happen then?
Of course, the magnetic field within the coil will change, so a current will flow
through the coil. That is, the electromagnet of the motor that we have rotated by
passing current through it, if we rotate that electromagnet or coil, the reverse
