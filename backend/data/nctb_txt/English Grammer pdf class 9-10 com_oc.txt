Preface
The importance of formal education is diversified. The prime goal of modern education
is not to impart knowledge only but to build a prosperous nation by developing skilled
human resources. At the same time. education is the best means of creating a society free
from superstitions and adheres to science and facts. To stand as a developed nation in the
science and technology-driven world of the 21st century. we need to ensure quality
education. A well-planned education is essential for enabling our new generation to face
the challenges of the age and to motivate them with the strength of patriotism, values, and
ethics. In this context, the government is determined to ensure education according to the
demand of the age.
Education is the backbone of a nation and a curriculum provides the essence of formal
education. Again, the most important tool for implementing a curriculum is the textbook.
The National Curriculum 2012 has been adopted to achieve the goals of the National
Education Policy 2010. In light of this, the National Curriculum and Textbook Board
(NCTB) has been persistently working on developing, printing, and distributing quality
textbooks. This organization also reviews and revises the curriculum, textbook, and
assessment methods according to needs and realities.
Secondary education is a vital stage in our education system. This textbook is catered to
the age, aptitude, and endless inquisitiveness of the students at this level, as well as to
achieve the aims and objectives of the curriculum. It is believed that the book written and
meticulously edited by experienced and skilled teachers and experts will be conducive to
a joyful experience for the students. Itis hoped that the book will play a sigvificant role
in promoting creative and aesthetic spirits among students along with subject knowledge
and skills.
Communicative grammar is a comparatively new trend in the field of English language
teaching. The main difference between conventional and communicative grammar is
characterized by the teaching and learning approaches, The traditional grammar bool
explains the rules and focuses on usage while communicative grammar presents items in
contexts and creates opportunities to use the language accurately as well as fluently.
Thus, communicative grammar promotes accuracy alongside fluency and helps develop
language acquisition. Again, the ‘composition part’ in the book introduces the process
approach so that the students can express and organize ideas in writing without
memorizing various genres of writing in English. Tt is hoped that the English Grammar
and Composition books for grades VI-X will develop students” grammatical competence
and writing skills.
It may be mentioned here that due to the changing situation in 2024 and as per the needs
the textbook has been reviewed and revised for the academic year 2025. Meticulous
attention has been paid to the textbook to make it more learner-friendly and error-free.
However, any suggestions for further improvement of this book will be appreciated.
Finally, T would like to thank all those who have contributed to the book as writers,
editors, reviewers, illustrators, and graphic designers.
October. 2024 Prof. Dr. A K M Reazul Hassan

GRAMMAR

0I The Noun 1/1:Kinds of Nouns
A Read the following passage and notice the underlined words:
Shakespeare was born in 1564 at
Stratford-upon-Avon in England.
He was a poet, playwright and actor.
He is widely regarded as one of the A g
greatest writer in English and the F
most prominent dramatist of
the world. He enjoys enormous ;
popularity even in the modern 4
age for his plays and poems. Lt
These are all nouns. The noun is a naming word. It may name a person, place
or thing. There is a bewildering variety of things in the world. So there is a
bewildering number of nouns in a language.
Look back at the nouns in the passage above and think what they name.
There are five kinds of nouns in English. They are:

1. Proper nouns

2. Common nouns

3. Collective nouns

4. Material nouns

5. Abstract nouns

Activity 1 Notice the underlined words in the following passage and say
what they refer to:
Rajshahi is a divisional city in Bangladesh. It is in the western part of the
country. It stands on the river Padma. My friend Alamgir lives in this city. He is
a professor of History. | often visit him and discuss many things with him. He
speaks good English.
These are all proper nouns. A proper noun is the name of a particular person,
place or thing. For example, “Rajshahi” is the name of a particular city and
“History” is the name of a particular subject. Think of the other proper nouns
in the passage. A proper noun usually begins with a capital letter. A proper
noun is usually singular but some proper nouns are plural in form.

them.

Activity 2 Notice the underlined words in the following passage:
Nasima is a beautiful girl. She is a bright student too. She reads in a local
college, She has many friends. She discusses her lessons with them. She
attends classes regularly. Every teacher is fond of her.
These are common nouns. A common noun refers to every person, place or
thing of the same class or kind. It does not refer to anything in particular. For
example, the noun ‘girl’ may mean any girl in the world. A common noun can
be both singular and plural. For example:
London is a big city.
There are many big cities in the world.
Note: A proper noun can be used as a common noun. Look at the following
examples:
He is called the Shakespeare (= the greatest dramatist) of Bangladesh.
There are two Raghibs in this class.
B Look at the underlined nouns in the following passage:
Salam comes of a big family. He has three brothers. His elder brother is a
member of Parliament. His younger brother has recently joined the army. His
other brother is a cricketer who plays for the national team. Salam himself is a
Civil Servant who works for the government.
These are collective nouns. A collective noun is the name of a collection or
group of people or things taken together. For example, an army is a group of
soldiers and a team is a group of players. Think of the other nouns in the
passage as a group of persons spoken of as one whole. A collective noun can
take both singular and plural verbs after it. For example:
The government has/have decided on a new pay scale.
The committee was/were in favour of my proposal.

Mrs. Rahman is now visiting a jeweller. She will buy some gold and silver to

make some jewellery. Next, she will also go to a grocery shop. She needs to

buy sugar, tea, milk and oil.

These are material nouns. A material noun names a thing that has weight but

cannot be counted. It is a kind of mass noun which is considered uncountable.

It refers to any material or substance. The substance may be solid, liquid or

gaseous. “Oxygen” is also a material noun.

D Look at the underlined nouns in the following passage:

Mr. Hague was a freedom fighter. He is known for his bravery. He is working for

a private company now. Everybody loves him for his honesty and sincerity. He

is an admirer of freedom and justice.

These are abstract nouns. An abstract noun is the name of a quality, state or

concept. It has no material form, shape or size.

Activity 3 Think of some other abstract nouns and make a sentence with
each of them.

Activity 4 Identify the nouns in the following passage, and say whether
they are Proper, Common, Collective, Material or Abstract
nouns.

Hasan is a rich farmer who lives in a village in the district of Sirajganj. He has a

cattle and other domestic animals. They provide him with milk and meat.

Hasan is a kind man. He has love and sympathy for the poor class of people.

(i) Mr. Aslam is a teacher. His wife is a banker. They have only one
child. Theirs is a small family. They live a happy life.

(ii) Mr. and Mrs. Hasan are teachers. They have two children. Both of
them are students. All the four members of this family are fond of
books.

In the first passage each of the underlined nouns denotes only one person or
thing. On the other hand, each underlined noun in the second passage denotes
more than one person or thing.
This is related to number. A noun that denotes one person or thing is said
to have a singular form. For example, the nouns in the first passage (teacher,
banker, child, family and life) are all singular in form. On the contrary, a noun
that denotes more than one person or thing is said to have a plural form. For
example, all the nouns in the second passage (teachers, children, students,
members and books) are plural in form.
Number is a grammatical distinction which tells whether a noun (also a
iw, Pronoun, verb or determiner) is singular or plural. There are two numbers in
= English — the Singular and the Plural.

Note: Most nouns are made plural by adding an s to the singular form.
(ii) Singular + es = plural

Note: Plurals are formed by adding es when the singular form ends in s, ss, sh,
ch and x.
(iii) Singular + ies = plural
baby babies
lady ladies
story stories
duty duties
fly flies
Note: Singular nouns ending in a consonant + y form their plurals by dropping
y and adding ies.
c Plural forms of nouns can also be made in other ways. Notice the
following examples:
(i) Singular nouns ending in f/fe form their plurals by dropping f/fe and
adding ves:

In this passage ‘he’ and ‘we’ are pronouns; ‘reads’, is’, ‘go’ and ‘share’ are
verbs, and ‘my’ and ‘our’ are determiners. You can easily guess which of these
words are singular and which are plural. Remember, whether a verb is singular
or plural is determined by its subject. A singular subject takes a singular verb
and a plural subject takes a plural verb.

founder of this school. It is one of the best schools in Rajshahi. Will you go to
the Headmistress’s chamber and talk to her about your daughter's admission?
These are all possessive forms of nouns. The possessive case is a grammatical
phenomenon which indicates relationship or ownership.
Note: The possessive case is formed in mainly two ways:
(i) When the noun is singular, its possessive form will be noun +s:
For example:
Della’s hair is very long.
This is Nazma’s bag.
However, in some possessives the letter s is omitted in order to avoid a hissing
sound.
For example:
Gi I have done it for conscience” sake.
=
8 You should sacrifice it for goodness’ sake.


--- Page 17 ---
12 English Grammar and Composition
(ii) When the noun is plural and ends in s, the possessive case is formed by
adding only an apostrophe and no s after it.
For example:
She reads in a girls’ school.
Horses’ tails are short.
But other plurals take (apostrophe + s) in their possessive forms:
For example:
These are children’s books.
This is 2 women’s club.
Activity 1 Correct the following sentences using the possessive forms of
the nouns in bold:
(i} Nazrul father is seriously ill. He is now at death door. His recovery
at this stage completely depends on Fortune favour.
(ii) Mr. Haque is ill. He is on three days casual leave. In case of
emergency, he can apply for one month medical leave.
(iii) Yesterday | visited Mr. Islam and Mr. Kabir families. But | could
not visit Mr. Rahim and Mrs. Rahim family.
B Here are some more examples of the possessive forms of nouns:
Bangladesh's foreign policy is admirable.
We must obey Nature's laws.
He was at his wit’s end.
| ate to my heart's content.
Everything is at my fingers’ ends.
He has lost a pound’s weight.
Everything depends on heaven's will.
His house is only at a stone’s throw from mine.
It is not your money's worth.
It is a day's journey from here to Dhaka. g

C Nouns in Apposition :
Apposition means “placing near”. It is a grammatical arrangement in which
two words referring to the same person or thing are placed side by side ina
sentence.
Read the following passage and notice the underlined words.
Mr. Rahman, our Headmaster, is a very nice man. My friend, Nazrul and | saw
him yesterday. He discussed many things with both of us. He also talked about
his childhood days. We alse met his wife, Mrs Salma Begum. She is our English
teacher. We like both of them.
In the first sentence, Rahman and Headmaster refer to the same person. The
noun “Headmaster” follows the noun “Rahman” simply to mean which
Rahman is referred to. Here the second noun “Headmaster” is said to be in
apposition to the first noun “Rahman”.
Similar is the case with “Nazrul” in the second sentence. It is in apposition to
the first noun “friend”. The second noun in such a situation is also called an
appositive,
Activity 2 Find out the other appositive in the passage:
Activity 3 Read the following passage and identify the appositives in it:
We, the students of class nine, are going to publish a magazine. Kazal, the first
boy of our class, will be the chief editor of the magazine. Mr. Rafiq, our class
teacher, is our chief adviser. We believe that many students will write for the
magazine.

February. January is the coldest month in Bangladesh. The most interesting
feature of winter Bangladesh is — the country is full of interesting vegetables
and delicious pitha, a kind of handmade cakes. Many foreigners like
Bangladeshi winter as it is milder than the winter in many parts of the world
such as England, Canada, or Russia.
You know, my father produces winter vegetables every year. I'm very fond of
bottle gourds. This time the gourds are bigger and nicer than the previous
years. Hope they will taste more interesting too. Well, | got to go now. Write to
me soon.

Adjectives 23
What are the words in bold doing?
All these words in bold are adjectives.
Same of them come before a noun and madify it, e.g. give extra information about it.
Some of the words are completing the sentences.
Thus adjectives work either as noun modifiers or as complements (that
completes) of a sentence.
Adjectives have three forms:
Positive use of adjectives without comparing
e.g. The temperature is moderate,
Comparative use of adjectives to compare two things or persons
e.g. This time the gourds are bigger and nicer than the
previous years.
Superlative use of adjectives to show the best or worst (comparison
between many)
e.g. January is the coldest month in Bangladesh.
Grammar Rules
We form comparative and superlative adjectives in this way:
short adjectives with one syllable
1. for comparative: By adding —er.
mild milder
for superlative : By adding -est
mild milder mildest
short adjectives ending with one vowel and one consonant
2. for comparative: by doubling the consonant and adding —er
BS big bigger
=


--- Page 29 ---
24 English Grammar and Composition
for superlative: by doubling the consonant and adding —est
big bigger biggest
short adjectives ending with -e
3. for comparative: By adding —r for comparative
nice nicer
for superlative: By adding —st for superlative
nice nicer nicest
Long adjectives with two or more syllables
4. for comparative: by adding more with the adjectives
interesting more interesting
for superlative: by adding most with the adjectives
interesting more interesting most interesting
adjectives ending with -y
5. for comparative: by changing y to —ier
dirty dirtier
for superlative: by changing y to —iest
dirty dirtier dirtiest
6. There are some adjectives that do not follow any rule. We call them
irregular adjectives. We need to remember their other forms. Such as
good better best
bad worse worst
far farther farthest a

With other verbs, we add the auxiliary_do/does before the subject and the
main verb (in the infinitive): He teaches English. Does he teach English?
They live in Khulna. Do they live in Khulna?
If we are using an auxiliary or modal (is, will, have, can, etc.) in a question, we
put the subject after the auxiliary or modal:
He is reading. Is he reading?
He can swim well. Can he swim well?
Making a negative: To make the negative of be, we can add not or n't to the
main verb: lam a teacher. | am not a teacher.
He is an artist. He is not/isn’t an artist.

they refer to.
Phil Johnson's father owned a laundry, so he gave his son a job hoping the boy
would work into the business. But Phil hated the laundry, so he dawdled, loafed
and did what he had to do only. Some days he was absent. His father was so
hurt to think he had a shiftless, ambitionless son that he was actually ashamed
before his employees.
One day Phil Johnson told his father he wanted to be a mechanic — work in a
machine shop. The old man was shocked. But Phil had his way. He did much
harder work than he had to do in the laundry. He worked longer hours, and he
whistled at his job! He took up engineering, learned about engines — and when
Philip Johnson died, in 1944, he was president of the Boeing Aircraft Company.

Form
The simple past is the past tense form that uses the main verb without an
auxiliary. For most verbs in English, the simple past tense is formed with the
ending —ed to the infinitive of the verb:
look - looked talk — talked
But some verbs are different and they don't end with —ed in their past form.
These are called irregular verbs:
go-went make — made take — took
The verb be has a different past simple form:
be - was/were
To make a question with be in the past simple, we usually put the verb before
"the subject: :
Was he a clerk in the bank?
Were Taniya and Reza class mates?
Where were you yesterday?
To make questions with other verbs in the simple past, we usually use did +
subject + infinitive:
Did you buy that book?
When did he visit England?
Why did he go there?
To make a negative, we add not/n’t to was/were and did:
No, he wasn’t a clerk in the bank.

We use the past simple to talk about an action or happening at a definite time

in the past:

I mailed the letter yesterday.
I met her two years ago.

We often use the simple past with expressions such as yesterday, last week, in

1952, when I was in school, three days ago, etc.

1.30 | called her on cell phone. She was near Ashuganj.
6.00 She reached Sylhet and called me.
7.30 | spoke to her again. She was cooking dinner.
Now see how Habib reported the whole thing to Salma a few days later.
When | reached Nargis’ house at 11.15, she had already left home for Sylhet.
She had waited for me till 11.00 and then left with her father in their family
car. When | talked to her at 1.30 pm, she hadn't yet reached Ashuganj, but was
close to it. At 6.00 she called to say that she had just reached Sylhet.

p.m. he saw four patients. That is, by 6.30 he had seen four patients. From
6.30 to 9 p.m. he saw eight patients. From 9 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. he saw another
six patients. That means by 10.30 the doctor had seen eighteen patients. 2

He had been seeing patients since 5 o'clock. In other words, by the time it was
10.30, Dr. Akram had been seeing patients for five and a half hours.

How many patients had Dr. Akram seen by 9 p.m.? He had seen twelve

patients.

Use
We use the past perfect to describe an action completed before a certain
moment in the past:

When | reached her house at 11.15, she had already left for Sylhet. She
had left at 11.00.

If two actions happened in the past, the past perfect is often used to show
which action happened earlier than the other:

When | called her at 7.30, she had already unpacked.

We use the past perfect continuous for an action that began before a certain
point in the past and continued up to that time:

It was 9 p.m. Dr. Akram was seeing a patient. He had started seeing
patients at 5 p.m. He had been seeing patients for four hours. He had
been seeing patients since 5.00.

Activity 1 Read the following paragraph and fill in the blanks with the
appropriate form (simple past or past perfect) of verbs in the
brackets:

Dr. Akram asked Fahim when the rash (start). Fahim said that he

(notice) it a week ago. He also said that he (go) to another
doctor before, but since the rashes got worse, he had come to Dr. Akram. Dr.

and can type too. But she cannot use a word processor. She realizes that to get
a good secretarial job, she must learn to use a computer. She also has to
improve her English which is not very good. This morning she goes to an
English Language Centre that a friend has recommended. At the administrative
office there she has the following conversation with a member of the official
staff:

Admin staff : Good morning! Can | help you?

Rehana : Morning. Could you please tell me when the next
English course starts?

Admin staff: Well, we have different courses like General
Communicative English, Business English, and English for
nurses and so on. Which one would you like to do?

Rehana : The Business English course. Could you tell me when the
next course starts and what the fee is?

Admin staff : Sure, It's a three-month course and the fee is Taka 5000.
Would you like to take a brochure — you can find details
about all the courses that we offer. You might like to have
a look at them.

Rehana : Thanks a lot.

Notice the words in bold. They are called modal verbs or modal

auxiliaries. .

Verbs : Modals 75
Grammar point
There are two kinds of auxiliary verbs in English:
Primary auxiliaries: am/is/ are/was/were, have/has/had, do/does/did
Modal auxiliaries: can/could, may/might, will/weuld, shall/should,
must/ought to/need
Modal auxiliaries are different from Primary auxiliaries in the following ways:
Past tense forms: The primary auxiliaries have past tense forms. The modal
auxiliaries do not. For example, must or may do not have a past form. (may
and might can refer to the same time: present or future)
Third person forms: The primary auxiliaries have third person forms (he/she+
is/has/does). Modal auxiliaries do not change. They have no —s form.
Infinitives: The primary auxiliaries are related to an Infinitive: to be, to
have, or to do. There is no infinitive form for the modal auxiliaries. (We do
not say to can, or to might.)
Note: Need fits into both categories.
It can be used as a full verb: need, needs, needed, e.g.
We need sugar. He needs rest. They needed some money.
It can also be used as a modal auxiliary verb:
We needn’t take a taxi. We needn't go to the doctor.
Use
We use modals to express a variety of moods or attitudes towards actions or
events in the past, present or future. Modals can be used to express
possibility, certainty, ability to do something, requests, permission,
obligation, necessity, prohibition, advice, etc.

Can and could are modal verbs, and are used like auxiliaries before the main
verb.
We make the negative by adding not/n’t to can/could. Note how we write
cannot. There is no break between can and not:
| cannot fly like a bird.
To make questions we say can /could + name/pronoun + main verb:
Can/could you pass me the salt, please? Can you use a
computer?
Use
Can/could for ability, and cannot for inability/prohibition:
We use can to express ability: | can sing and I can dance.
In the sentence But I cannot fly like a bird, cannot expresses lack of ability.
The past tense of can as ability is could: Two years ago | could walk for miles,
but now | cannot.
We use cannot/can’t to express prohibition: You cannot bring mobile phones
into the classroom, and you cannot chew gums in my class.
For permission and requests:
We use can/could to give or ask for permission. Can is less formal than could.
Can | borrow your pen? Oh, sure!
Could | use your laptop, please? You could take it to your room, if you like.

Form
May and might are modal verbs and are used, like auxiliary verbs, to express
different meanings of the main verb.
In a positive sentence, we use may/might + verb
For negatives, we use may not/might not + verb
Note: May/ might are not usually used in a question form to mean
possibility.
We can use may in a question to express asking for or giving
permission. For example,
May | sit here? Yes, you may. May | see that book? No, you may not.
However, this sounds very formal in everyday situations now, and
can/could are used more frequently.
We use may/might to refer to the present or future time:
It may rain this evening.
The shoes might be too small for you.
He may be in his office now.
Use We use may or might to say that something is possible but not certain,
now or in future:
He may not be in office now.
You may see him in office tomorrow.
He might offer you the job.

Note: May implies stronger possibility than might, i.e. might, like may,
expresses possibility, but in a lesser degree. For example, if we say, ‘We might
go to the museum today’, there is less chance of going there than when we
say, ‘We may go to the museum today’.
Another function of may is to express permission:
May | use your telephone? May | ask you a question?
Those who have finished writing may leave the exam hall.
Activity 1 Write may/might + an appropriate verb in the following gaps.

Will and won't are used to predict a future event which is seen as certain:
My family and | will go to attend my cousin's wedding tomorrow.
We will meet at the school ground at 7.00.
Note that in conversations we usually use won't in place of will not.
Also we don’t generally use will not in negative questions. Instead, we say,
‘Won't you come to see me off at the airport?’
We use would for invitations, requests, and for polite conversations:
Would you like to join us for the river cruise? I'd love to.
What would you like to have, tea or coffee?
We usually use the contracted form of would ('d) after words ending in a vowel
sound:
I'd/ we'd/ he'd/she’d, etc.
But we don’t say, Jt'd’ (x), instead, we'd say ‘It would’.

06 Kinds of 6/1: Verb: linking,
Verbs transitive, intransitive
A. Read the following passage and look at the underlined verbs .
Mr. Kamal is a big scholar. He is our English teacher. He has written many
books. All his books are very good. He has a lot of money. He comes to school
in his own car. He himself drives the car. He drives very carefully.
Look at the words/phrases after these verbs. In the first two sentences ‘is’ is
followed by a noun phrase and the noun phrase refers to the subject of the
sentence. So, ‘is” here is a linking verb. A linking verb is followed by a noun or
adjective which refers to the subject. There is another linking verb in the
passage. Find it out. Some verbs are followed by a noun which is different from
the subject. For example, “has written”. It is a transitive verb.
A transitive verb is followed by an object (a noun that answers who/what). In
the passage, two verbs are followed by an adverbial. They are intransitive
verbs. Intransitive verbs do not have any object i.e. intransitive verbs do not
answer who/what. Try yourself and find out these verbs.
B Identify the transitive, intransitive and linking verbs in the following
passage.
Nasima is a student. She is a student of class VII. She attends classes
regularly. Today she has worn a new dress. She looks very smart in this
dress. The teacher praised her in the class.
C Look at some more linking verbs in the following sentences:
(i) She got nervous in the class.
(ii) The man has gone mad.
(iii) The food tastes delicious.

(ii) He reads a lot of story books.

(iii) | shall take a cup of tea now.

kill, prey, sell, draw, learn
E Here are some more example of intransitive verbs.

(i) The baby is sleeping.

(ii) Boys are playing in the field.

(iii) He was killed in an accident.

Note: An intransitive verb may be followed by nothing or it may be

followed by any number of adverbials.
Activity 1 Now use the following verbs as intransitive in your own
sentences :

walk work die laugh open

Remember, the same verb may be used as linking, transitive or intransitive,
It depends on how you use it.
For example:

He ran home. (intransitive)

The river runs dry in summer. (linking)

| ran a race. (transitive)
Can you think of any other verb like this? Use it in 3 different ways.

verbs that can be followed by either an infinitive or by ~ing.

The to infinitive

a Karim wanted to tell Bahar the truth. But at the same time he
didn’t want to upset him, He arranged to meet Raju in the
afternoon and decided to ask for his advice,

b If you want to buy fresh vegetables, remember to go to the
farmer's market early in the morning.

c We were going to spend the weekend in a resort in Bhawal,
Gazipur. On the way, we stopped to buy petrol and then we
stopped again to buy some oranges and apples. Still we
expected to reach the resort in time.

d Shihab loves to ride his bike for going long distances. But he
often forgets to wear his helmet This morning when he was
taking his bike out, his mother came out and said to him, “Good
to see that you remembered to wear your helmet, dear. Be
careful on the road and remember not to drive too fast.

want, hope, intend, expect, plan, try, manage, arrange, fail, wish, etc.

will not do something, such as agree, refuse, offer, promise, etc.

e.g. Rahela had agreed to sell her computer at half price to
me, but refused to do so at the last moment. | offered to
give a slightly higher price, and she accepted that. |
promised not to make any more deals with her.

The negative form is not + to infinitive:
e.g. Remember not to drive too fast.
I've decided not to accept the offer.

and without to.
My friend and | went to watch an English film on DVD at the British
Council Library yesterday. It was a very funny film and it made us laugh.
We tried hard not to laugh out loud and disturb other people but just
couldn’t stop. It was a story about a family where the parents let the
children do anything they wanted. We were laughing so much that
ultimately the assistant librarian came and made us leave. We'll
remember the incident for a long time to come.
Grammar point
We use the infinitive without to after modal verbs (will, can, could, may,
might, must, should, etc.)
e.g. We couldn't stop. We'll remember the incident.
We use the infinitive without to after make and let:
make/let + object + infinitive without to

A Read the story below.
It was a nice day. Anna and her mother wanted to go out and enjoy the lovely
weather. Anna wanted to go hiking in the woods or, she said, they could go
swimming or fishing in the lake. But finally they went sailing. They were in the
middle of the lake when the wind started to blow. The boat rocked from side
to side because of the high waves. Anna was happy and started singing in a
loud and clear voice. But Anna's mother didn’t want to get wet and turned the
boat around.
When they reached the shore, Anna immediately jumped out of the boat and
started running around on the beach. She suddenly stopped walking because
she felt something under her feet. She picked up her foot since she wanted to
see what was there. She was surprised to find a beautiful shell. She took the
shell, rubbed off the sand around it and, it started to shimmer in the bright
sunlight.
Grammar point
Look at the words in bold in the story above. Notice that when we want to use
two verbs together, we use either to + infinitive or the —ing form of the main
verb in the sentence.
Some verbs can be followed by either form, but some can only be used with
the —ing form.
Verbs that can be followed only by v+ing form are:

Verbs, like start, like or love can be used with the —ing form as well as with the
to + infinitive without any change in meaning. For example,
| love to read poetry. | love reading poetry.
| like dancing. | like to dance.
He's started going to the gym. He's started to go to the gym.
Note: It is important to understand that although some verbs can be
used with both the —ing form and the to + infinitive, the choice may lead to a
change of meaning of the sentence, for example:
a Do you remember leaving a message for her?
(You already left a message for her.)
Remember to leave a message for her.

Gerund vs Participle
Gerund
People remain confused between gerund and participle because of their
similarities. Both are formed when ing is added to a verb. There is another
similarity, and that is the fact that both gerund and participle indicate some
action or state of being. However, there are differences between them that
will be highlighted in this article.
Participle
As indicated above, a participle can be made by adding ing to a verb. However,
it becomes a participle only when adding ing to the verb makes it function as
an adjective.
What is the difference between Gerund and Participle?

= A gerund is a verbal noun (verb made noun by adding ing) that is derived

from a verb but functions as a noun.

= A participle is a verbal that functions as an adjective.

* Both are made by adding ing to verbs.

e Verb and noun combined is a gerund whereas verb and adjective

combined is a participle.

07 The Adverb 7/1: Adverbs and
their Functions
A Read the following conversation and notice the underlined words:
Alim : Where are you now?
Hasan : I'm going home after finishing my exam.
Alim : How did you do in the exam?
Hasan : I've done very well.
Alim : Can you see me tomorrow?
Hasan : Why?
Alim : I've an urgent talk with you. I'm eagerly waiting for you.
Hasan : Okay, I'll certainly see you.
Do these words tell you anything about the time, place and manner of an
action? Yes, they do and so they are adverbs. An adverb is a part of speech
which usually modifies the meaning of a verb. It generally says where, when
and how an action takes place.
B The main function of an adverb is to modify a verb. But it has some
other subsidiary functions too. Look at the following examples:
This mango is very sweet.
You have done quite well.
Nearly everybody was late.
The grapes were well within my reach.
| can’t go there just because I'miill.
Fortunately, he survived the accident.
Notice the items after the adverbs in these sentences. You can then see that
adverbs may modify an adjective (sweet), another adverb (well), a pronoun
(everybody), a preposition (within), a conjunction (because) and a sentence
5] (he survived the accident). These are the different functions of an adverb.

They rarely talk with each other.
Unfortunately, he failed the test.
He lost almost everything.
He came here simply because he wanted to meet me.

7/2: Kinds of
Adverbs
A Read the following passage and notice the adverbs:
Salam is trying hard to go abroad for higher studies. He saw me today to
discuss the matter with me. He often seeks my advice.
There are four adverbs in this passage and they are of four different kinds.
+ The adverb ‘hard’ answers the question “how?”. It is called an adverb of
manner.
+ “Abroad” answers the question “where?”. It is called an adverb of
place.
« “Today” answers the question “when?”. It is called an adverb of time. 3
NN


--- Page 118 ---
The Adverb 113
« “Often” expresses the frequency of an action. It is called an adverb of
frequency.
* These are the four main types of adverbs.
Now, identify the four kinds of adverbs in the following passage.
Khan is a busy man. He seldom calls me. But yesterday he requested me to go
downtown with him. | could not say no to him. He invited me very cordially.
B There are also some other kinds of adverbs. Read the following
sentences and notice the adverbs in them.
(i) The boy is very smart.
He is too weak to walk.
The girl is fairly tall.
He looked at me quite indifferently.
His statement was absolutely true.
These are called adverbs of degree. They intensify the meaning of an adjective
or adverb. In current English, they are called Intensifiers.
Think of two/three other adverbs of degree and make sentences with them.
(ii) Where are you going?
When do you sleep at night?
How did you do the work?
Why are you laughing?
These are called interrogative adverbs, These adverbs are used for asking
questions about the place, time, manner and cause of an action.
Notice where they are used.
{iiii) You will surely/certainly pass the exam.
| did not go there.
‘Do you like cricket?” “Yes, | do.
‘Will you come here?" ‘No, | won't”

114 English Grammar and Composition
There are adverbs of affirmation and negation in these sentences.
Cc Adverbs may take different positions in a sentence. Look at the
following examples:
The boy is reading loudly.
They were boating downstream.
| am very busy now.
The adverbs of manner, place and time are usually used after the verbs they
modify. Use some other such adverbs in this position.
But an adverb of frequency is usually used between the subject and the verb.
For example:
He always speaks the truth.
It hardly rains here.
They rarely eat together.
He usually comes here in the afternoon.
Adverbs of degree are used before an adjective or adverb. For example:
He is totally mad.
It is raining very hard.
Interrogative adverbs are always used at the beginning of a sentence. For
example:
Where was he born?
Why are you so callous?
Adverbs actually do not have any fixed position in a sentence. They can change
their position to serve different functions.

7/3: Adverbials
A Read the following questions and think of their answers:
When will you see me?
Where are you going now?
How is it raining?
How frequently does he visit you?
Why are you waiting here?
Each of the first four questions can be answered by using a single word. For
example, you can say:
| shall see you tomorrow.
| am going downstairs.
It is raining hard /heavily.
He scarcely visits me.
These single words are adverbs. You have seen their use in the preceding
lessons. But you can answer any of the above questions by using a group of
words. For example, you can say:
| shall see you in the afternoon.
| am going to school.
It is raining very hard.
He visits me thrice a week.
| am waiting here to receive my friend.
These are all adverbial phrases. An adverbial phrase is a group of words that
modifies a verb in the sentence.
Identify the adverbial phrases in the following conversation:
Mukta: When are you going to Dhaka?
Mukul: I'm going there next week.
Mukta: Why are you going?
9 Mukul: I'm going there to attend a seminar.

B Adverbs and Adverbial phrases have a common name. This name is
Adverbial. That means, an adverbial is a single word or a group of words
which modifies a verb. Look at the underlined words/phrases in the
following sentences:

(i) Rashid saw me yesterday.

| asked him to come in the morning.

It was raining then,

I shall go to Dhaka next week.
These words/phrases are called adverbials of time.
(ii) Can you come here?

1 went there to invite my friend.

He was born in a big city.

| am living in an apartment.
These words/phrases are called adverbials of place.
(iii) ~~ He speaks loudly.

She was brutally killed.

The problem was solved in an amicable way.

He was wounded very seriously.

These words/phrases are called adverbials of manner.
(iv) It often rains here.
He never tells a lie.
She phones me four times a day.
| go to Dhaka almost every week.
These words/phrases are called adverbials of frequency.

The Adverb 17
(v) | went home to take rest.
He is going abroad for higher studies.
She studies hard to pass the exam.
They jumped into the pond to save the child.
These phrases are called adverbials of purpose.
(vi) An adverbial may also be a dependent clause in a complex
sentence. For example:
I shall go home after he comes.
The girl had been married off before she was 18.
You can sit wherever you like.
It is raining like the sky is falling.
The flight was delayed because the weather was foggy.
Note: Anything—be it a word, phrase or clause—that modifies a verb is an
adverbial. All adverbs are adverbials but all adverbials are not adverbs.
[o Read the following passage and identify the different kinds of
adverbials in it:
One day | was sitting alone upon a bench at a park near my house. Suddenly, a
young girl arrived there. She was beautifully dressed. She sat beside me and
began to talk with me very cordially. We talked for about half an hour and then
we began to walk together. Within a short time we became good friends.
When we parted, we promised never to forget each other. We now phone
each other every day. We visit each other almost regularly.

Activity 1 Write down ten independent clauses about yourself.
B The Subordinate Clause
A subordinate clause is a group of words that has a subject and a
predicate but cannot stand by itself as complete sentence because it
does not express a complete thought. While an independent clause
can stand alone as a complete thought, a subordinate clause cannot
stand alone. Subordinate clauses are sometimes called dependent
clauses.
Lock at the following examples. Each sentence has two parts, and in
each part there is a subject and a predicate. However, the second part
in the first sentence and the first part in the second sentence cannot
stand alone, and therefore, they are subordinate clauses.
The crowds cheered to greet Mashrafi when he entered the stadium.
As he walked across the field, he waved back to the audience.
Study the following sentences, which contain subordinate clauses.
Notice that the subordinate clauses are introduced by words like
since, when, if, as, who, which and that.
Luna, who was the Roman goddess of the moon, gave us the
word lunatic
Since at one time the moon was believed to cause madness,
people avoided moonlight.
Anyone that slept with the moon shining in his/her face might
Fe) become mad.

128 English Grammar and Compasition
Even today many people feel uncomfortable if the moon shines
in on them while they are sleeping.

(The examples above have been taken from Warriner’s English Grammar and

Composition, 1973)

A sentence may have more than one subordinate clause. For example,

see the last sentence above.

B1 Kinds of subordinate clauses:

A subordinate clause may function as an adjective, an adverb, or a

noun.

i) Clauses used as adjectives: A subordinate clause functions as an
adjective if it modifies a noun or a pronoun. Such clauses are
sometimes called adjective clauses.

Look at the following sentences. The subjects of the subordinate

clauses are underlined, and the predicates are shown in bold type.

The movie that you recommended to me was good.

( Which movie? The one that you recommended to me.)

A doctor who takes care of children is a pediatrician.
(Which kind of doctor? A doctor who takes care of children.)

In the above sentences, the subordinate clauses, that you

recommended to me, and who takes care of children, are adjective

clauses.

Most adjective clauses begin with a relative pronoun:
that which who whom whose

Fal

~


--- Page 134 ---
Sentences 129
You may also introduce adjective clauses with relative adverbs:
after before since where why
for example: It was a place where crowds gathered in the evenings.
(Subordinate clause)

ii) Adverb Clauses: A subordinate clause functions as an adverb if it
modifies a verb, an adjective, or an adverb. Such clauses are sometimes
called adverb clauses.
Here are some examples of adverb clauses:
Before you buy a television, you should compare prices.
(modifies verb)
Aleya was proud that the theatre group chose her.
(modifies adjective)
Like adverbs, adverb clauses tell how, when, where, and to what extent.
They may also explain why.
Look at the following sentences:
How The building swayed as though it would collapse.
When Before the storm started, Nayan took shelter in a building.
Where We can have lunch wherever you want.
To What Extent Maya studied the poem until she had memorized it.
Why Shahed came early so that he would get a good seat.

130 English Grammar and Composition
iii) Noun Clauses: Some subordinate clauses function as nouns in
sentences.

Such clauses are called noun clauses. A noun clause may

function as a subject, a predicate nominative, a direct object, an

indirect object, an object of a preposition, or an appositive.

Examples:

Subject That he is generous is evident.

Predicate Nominative That is what we decided.

Direct Object | don’t know where Seema is.

Indirect Object Give whoever is coming a message.

Object of a Preposition | was criticized for what I did.

Appositive The subject of my speech, that taxes
should be lowered, was well
received.

You may introduce a noun clause with either an interrogative
pronoun (such as, who, whom,
whose, which, whatever, whoever,
whomever, etc.) or, a subordinating
conjunction (such as, how, that,
when, where, whether, why, etc.)

9/3: Sentences:
Structures and Types
In the previous lesson you have learned that sentences may be classified
according to their purpose or meaning: assertive (positive/negative),
interrogative, imperative and exclamatory. Another way to classify sentences
is according to their construction, the kind and number of their clauses.
A The Simple Sentence
A simple sentence has one independent clause and no subordinate
clauses.
Look at the examples of simple sentences below. Notice that a simple
sentence may have a compound subject (sentence 2) or a compound
predicate (sentence 3) or both (sentence 4). A compound subject consists of
two or more connected subjects that have the same verb. A compound
predicate consists of two or more connected verbs that have the same subject.

1 Bangladesh has some beautiful tourist spots.

2 The tea gardens in Sylhet and the forests of the Sundarbans are
favourite tourist attractions. (The two parts of the compound
subject have the same verb, are.)

3 We planned to go to Syhet but then went to the Sundarbans
instead.

Sentences 137
B The Compound Sentence
A compound sentence has two or more independent clauses but no
subordinate clauses.
The independent clauses are usually joined by some connecting or
linking wards such as, and, but, or, nor, for, yet, however, therefore, etc.
We can also join the independent clauses by using a semicolon.
Following are some examples of compound sentences:
| like jogging, but | like swimming better.
Razzak graduated last year, and now he works in a private bank.
| wanted to go to the concert, but | didn’t get the ticket.
The giraffe has a long neck and long legs, but it is a very graceful
animal.
Fruits and vegetables should be a part of everyone's diet, for
they supply necessary vitamins.

Cc The Complex Sentence
A complex sentence consists of one independent clause and one or
more subordinate clauses.

Zinia : Yes, it is indeed. We're going to stay the whole night, aren’t we?
Sam : Ithink so. By the way, | haven't seen you for a long time.
Zinia : lwas in the USA for six weeks.
Sam : Oh, really? You didn’t go there on business, did you?
Zinia : No, | didn’t. Actually | went there to attend my brother's graduation
ceremany.
Sam : You are not going away anywhere soon, are you?
Zinia : No, I'm not. You missed me, didn’t you?
If we study the above sentences, we notice that each of the sentence ends
with a question. These questions are different from the wh-questions or
‘yes/no’ questions. These are called tag questions.
We also notice that, if the statement is affirmative, the tag question is
negative. If the statement is negative, the tag question is affirmative.
So, a tag question is a kind of question asked by the speaker after a negative or
an affirmative statement during conversation. They are normally used in
speech when we want to:
= confirm that something is true or not, or
= to encourage a reply from the person we are speaking to.

146 English Grammar and Composition
1. Intonation and meaning:
When a tag question is spoken, the voice can go up or down.
It is a nice party, fo it?
A falling intonation means the speaker is sure (or almost sure) that the
statement is true. He/she only wants to confirm. The tag is not really a
guestion.
A rising intonation means that even though the speaker expects to hear ‘yes’,
the speaker is less sure and wants to know.
You didn’t go there on business, did you?
B Why do we use tag questions?
We can use tag questions to verify or check information that we think is true,
or to check information that we aren't sure about.
The interesting things about tag questions are that they have varied uses. The
tag question is in fact a typical feature of conversation in English.
Different uses of ‘tag questions’:
of Read the following tag questions:

You have known Shumona for a long time, haven't you?

Shumona is Bangladeshi, isn't she?

She lives in Dhaka, doesn’t she?

She has lived here all her life, hasn't she?

She went to Delhi for higher studies last year, didn’t she?

She speaks good English, doesn’t she?

She can help you, can’t she?

But she wouldn't, would she? g

~


--- Page 152 ---
Sentences 147
Note: If the verb used in the statement is an auxiliary verb, then the auxiliary
verh is repeated in the tag question. If a modal (can, could, will, should, etc.) is
used in the statement, then the same modal is used in the tag part. If the
statement doesn't use an auxiliary verb, then the auxiliary ‘do/ does/ did is
used in the tag question.
D Read the following tag questions.
He hardly watches movie, does he?
He never came back, did he?
Note: If there are words such as seldom, hardly, barely, scarcely, nothing,
none, no one, neither, few, little, never in a sentence, it is considered as a
negative sentence. Therefore, notice that tag questions are in affirmation.
E Read the following examples.
Nobody likes to be criticized, do they?
Everybody wanted to talk to the celebrity, didn’t they?
Note: If everybody, all, somebody, someone, anybody, any one, no one, none
is used as a subject, then the subject of the tag question would be ‘they’.
F Read the following examples.
Nothing was easy, was it?
Anything will be all right, will it?
Note: If anything, something, everything, nothing is used as a subject, then it’
would be used as a pronoun.
Read the examples below:

Dear Shovon,
I'm writing this to tell you about our day out at Savar yesterday. We went to
Jahangirnagar University to watch the migratory birds that come there every
winter. We started at 7 a.m. It was a very pleasant one and a half hour drive
from Dhaka to the University. It’s a beautiful campus! There is a lake running
through it. The scenic beauty of the place simply charmed us. There were
hundreds of migratory birds- some circling in the sky in flocks, some resting
on the lake water. There were red and white water lilies in full bloom in the
lake. We were not the only ones watching the birds, there were about a
dozen more visitors who came to enjoy the scene. There was enchanting
sound of birds chirping, splashing water and fluttering winds all around us. It
was such a splendid experience!
It was almost 4 o'clock when we started back from there for Dhaka. By the
way, we had a wonderful lunch at the campus. There was a roadside eating
place just outside the campus gate that served the best rice and curry I've
ever had.
But no more today.

work (subject). Since object is more important in the passive, object is used as
subject in the sentence.
It is funny to say — Some people established the school in 1856.
So we say — The school was established in 1856.
Read the above texts (1-7) again and see if they prove what is said here

itself is important, then we use passive form.
Sometimes we use by+agent, when both action and agent (doer) are
important to be focused. for example .

Lira: Sure! They should be. They are painted by Jainul Abedin!

2, Each piece is folded again across the middle and torn to make a

Now one of the pieces is placed on the table with the long sides pointing
down. A horizontal line is drawn across the top of the paper about a quarter of
the way from the top. Then two vertical lines are drawn downwards from the
horizontal line, so that the bottom part of the paper is divided into three
equal-size parts.
Next, the paper has to be torn along each of these vertical lines as far as the
horizontal line sothat three flaps are created. Then the left flap is folded
toward you and the right flap is folded away from you — the folds are made
right at the top of the flap. The centre flap should not be folded, though.
Now a paper clip has to be found and this is attached to the bottom of the
centre flap. Finally, the whole thing has to be raised high and is then allowed
to fall...

192 English Grammar and Composition
What differences do you find between the statements in Context 1 and
Context 2?
Grammar Point
A reporting speech is the statement of the person who reports about
something. We use reported speech when we are speaking or writing about
something that another person said.
A reported speech is the statement what is being reported by a speaker. This
statement is made by one person but reported by another person.
In direct speech we say exactly what was said or thought by others using verbs
like said, thought, told shouted, etc. (as in Context 1).
The common feature of direct speech is

inverted comma (“....") before and after the speech (made by other

than who is reporting).
When we report what someone js saying or thinking now we use indirect
speech after says, thinks, hopes etc. (as in Context2). Here we often use that
but that is not obligatory.
Example
| was speaking with Ranjan. He says (that) he has just left Barishal.
We also use this form when we say about something that is always true.
eg. He says he doesn’t like band music.
or
Dipika says we can create a better world by loving each other.

Speech 193
B Now read these sentences.
We said to Mithun that we were going to Sagardari to Michael's place.
She could join us.
Mithun told that without speaking to her mom she wouldn't be able to decide
anything.
Abid responded that was ridiculous as they all were grown up.
Mithun replied that it didnt mean they were out of any bindings.
Abid hoped that her mom will finally allow Mithun to go.
| felt it wouldn't be that easy.
However we all wished good luck for Mithun.
Grammar Point
We use said to report someone's words/statements
We use told when we make its clear who the speaker was speaking to.
We can use verbs that express the feeling of the speaker when we report what
someone has said or thought. For example, hope, feel, be afraid, want, wish.
C Read the following conversations. How does the reported speech
change when they are made indirect from direct?
Direct
Boby : Hi Probir, It is good to see you in Facebook.
Probir : Hi Boby. Good to see you too. How are you?
Boby :I'm good. Well, I've got three tickets for the cricket match.
Would you like to go with me?
Forma-25, English Grammar and Compasition, 3-10


--- Page 199 ---
194 English Grammar and Compasition
Probir : Hmmm... | have an appointment with my doctor. I'm sorry.
Boby : Okay. Next time.
Indirect
Boby greeted Probir and told it was good to see him in the Facebook.
In exchange Probir also greeted Boby and said that it was good to see
him too. He asked Boby how he was.
Boby replied that he was good. He also told that he had three tickets
for cricket match. He asked Probir if he would like to go with him.
With hesitation Probir told that he had an appointment with his doctor.
He was sorry.
Boby replied that it was ok and hoped they would go together next time.
In indirect speech we report things that people say. We often use said and
change the tense of the verb of the speaker used in the following way:
Actual words Reported speech
present simple past simple
present continuous past continuous
past simple/ past perfect
present perfect
will would
can could
am/is/are/going to was/were going to
o
a


--- Page 200 ---
Speech 195
Grammar Point
In informal speech we sometimes use the same tense that the person used
in the direct speech. Besides when we want to say something that someone
says about future we use the same tense used in the direct speech
Example
Hannan: I'm going to Bandarban tomorrow.
Hannan says that he is going to Bandarban the next day.

answer yes or no.

Note that when we change direct speech to indirect speech we do not

change word by word. We do some fine tuning to make the language lively.

Otherwise it becomes mechanical and unnatural. This is why in the above

indirect sentence it is written -

She confirmed that she would go as was free in the evening. We didn’t write

— She said that she would definitely come. She also said that she was free in

the evening.

This type of fine tuning is important far changing speech from direct to

indirect especially when you have a whale conversation to change.

your friend, Nandita. She told you about her friend. This is what she told
you:
Jibon and | have been friends for two years. | first got to know him at a
friend's birthday party. But we saw each other at another occasion before

with me too. | told him | didn’t really want to sing. Anyway, later | agreed.
Although he was a singer we sang together for some time. We didn’t leave
the party till 10 pm. Later we met each other frequently and gradually we
became good friends. We have so many differences but we respect each
other. Sometimes we fight but we never leave each other. This is why our
friendship is so unique.

I4 Letter 14/1:Informal Letters
Informal communication takes place in intimate circles, usually among friends
and family, and formal communication takes place among people whose
relationship is formal. In informal writing and speaking, we use lot of
contractions such as I'm, you're; I've, I'd etc. Idiomatic expressions or phrasal
verbs, exclamation, repetition, tag questions and use of slangs etc, are features
of informal writing and speaking. The following letter is an example of an
informal letter.

1 Read the letter and examine the features of informal style in this letter.
Dear Shuvro,

It’s really, really good to be here in Sylhet. We got here on Saturday
evening. The journey was HORRIBLE, the bus moved like a local bus, it
stopped quite a few times to pick passengers. It was really irritating. It
took twelve hours to get here! But the place we're staying is very nice —
the surroundings are beautiful. I'm having a good time with my family
now, but | miss you a lot.

It’s now Tuesday afternoon and I’m sitting at a tea- garden chatting
with some local boys. The weather is fantastic! It can lift your spirit.

With lots of love,

2. Now rewrite the letter changing some words and expressions to make

it sound a little more formal.

3. Here is another informal letter. Read the following letter and say what

aspects of the letter make it informal?

Hi Stella, |
It seems hard to believe that I've been here in Sylhet for a whole week
now. I promised to write and tell you how I was getting on-so here it goes.
When | first got here, | could not just get used to the new environment
with new friends, in new school. Now, though, I'm learning to take things
easy and I'm beginning to feel really at home. My first impression of the
Sylheti people is that they are really, really friendly and heipful.

I've managed to make friends with a few girls. The countryside round the
town is marvelous and very green, because it rains a lot here, but too
much of rain can really be boring.

Sorry this letter is short, but you know how bad I'm at writing letters. Do
write back when you've a spare minute. | miss you so much.

All my love,

Sumi
4. Now convert the letter into a somewhat more formal one.

5 Further tasks:

« Write a letter to your younger sister congratulating her on her success

in the JSC examination.
s Write a letter to your younger brother advising him how to prepare for
JSC examination.

film.

* Write a letter to your mother informing her that you had a bad cold,
but now you are good after you took some antibiotic prescribed by a
physician.

* Ask a friend to join your birthday party.

Review:
All personal letters are informal letters, but the degree of informality varies;
some are highly informal, some others are semi formal. The informal letters
are characterised as already mentioned above, by:
1. Use of colloquial words
2. Conversational tone
3. Use of contractions
4. Use of two word verbs
5. Use of slangs (in very intimate circle}
As mentioned earlier, degree of informality varies. For example,
When writing to parents, a letter may be a little less informal in its choice of
words and tone than a letter written to a very close friend. Contractions and
group verbs can be used with parents and other relations who are senior to us
and whom we respect, like our uncles and aunts etc, In such personal letters
highly emetional words and expressions and slangs should not be used.

preceding informal letters?
A formal letter is a letter that you write in formal situations, such as, a student
writing to the Head Teacher/Principal of an educational institute for a
scholarship or the waiver of the fees; a person writing an application for a job,
or someone writing a letter to the editor of a newspaper; or any other kinds of
business letter, such as an order or a complaint letter, etc.
In formal letters, no contraction, idioms or phrasal verbs, no colloquial or
conversational style or tone is used. An objective, detached style is used in
formal writings. Features of informal style mentioned above are not used in
formal letters.

Informal passage
A Discuss what makes the following passage informal.
Well, they had us take a look at the kids every day, and we'd write down lot of
things they did and said. There was this one teacher the kids really did things
for. This was because she was damn good at maths and could turn the kids on
to it. At the end of the week we all got together to talk about what we'd found
out since we got there. We all felt that you could pick up an awful lot about how
to teach just from watching what the kids did whenever the teacher told them
to do something.
B The passage below is the formal version of the above passage. How is
this passage stylistically different from the preceding passage?

We were assigned to observe the teacher daily to record their actions and
speech. What impressed us most was one teacher that the boys and girls
responded to eagerly because she knew her math thoroughly and made it
exciting. At the end of the week, when we met to discuss our conclusions, we
agreed that anyone can learn a good deal about teaching methods from merely
abserving the children’s responses to the teacher’s directions.
Now find out the formal expression used in passage B for the following
informal expressions used in Passage A. In the blanks under Formal
expressions write down each informal expression.

Activity 1
Read the following passage and identify the informal expressions in it. Then
change those with formal expressions.
One problem that plagues beginning teachers, and older teachers as well, is the
seeming lack of self- control of underprivileged children. Because their homes
are often characterized by an awful lot of fragmentation and instability, their
behaviour reflects their inability to keep real cool in situations involving adults.
... We think it important, therefore, that the teacher be calm and
understanding. For the teacher to be able to exhibit this kind of behavior when
confronting a bunch of adolescents, he must have achieved terrific level of
integration and security, so that his own psychic life is completely okay.
Each of the following sentences has expressions not suitable for formal writing.
Underline those, and give the formal expression for it in the line provided
against each sentence.
1. He has a lot of nerve. eee
2. There were a bunch of kids. ee eee

i5 CV and Cover Letter 15/1:
Writing CV

All/most of you will have to write effective Curriculum Vitae, in short, CV,
(called ‘resume’, in American English) for various purposes such as, to get a job
or scholarship, etc. Writing a good CV is a skill all of you will need for your
career.
The CV is meant to introduce you and your background to somebody who does
not know you. It should present you in the best possible light, in a concise and
well-structured manner. A regular CV for business purposes should definitely
not go over one A4 size page. If one wants to use it for academic purposes and
not for a job, the CV can pass that limit, and the additional space is used to
describe academic activities, like conferences, publications list etc.
A well written CV shows first what is most important, but contains all relevant
information. To this goal, it is advised that you adapt it to suit your target
{specific type of job or scholarship). Pay attention to the order in which you
present information in your CV.
Here is a guideline for writing a good CV. although there are a number of ways
for writing CV, they agree on same common details.
The information you need to provide in your CV are:
Personal details: Here you should include your date of birth, contact address,
telephone number and nationality. In case you have a permanent address
different from your temporary address, include both. Personal details can be
written with smaller fonts than the rest of the CV if you want to save space. You
should write your name with a bigger font than the rest of the text, so that the

- reader can easily see whose CV s/he is reading.

224 English Grammar and Composition
Objective: You should state very concisely what you accurately want to do. Say
something like, “To develop a career in .....", or you can be mare specific like “to
obtain a position in ... where | can use my skills in...” You can write a few lines to
describe that specifically, but keep in mind that you should show what you can
do for the organization or company you are sending the CV to more than what
the company can do for you. Writing a good objective is difficult, so take some
time to think about what exactly you are going to write there.

Academic achievements: After your personal details, give details about your
education. It is suggested that you present details about education in reverse
chronological order i.e., you start with the latest degree and go gradually back.
You should mention all your academic achievements including
grades/divisions/classes. You should also mention scholarships and awards you
received along with your achievements in co-curricular and extracurricular
activities in your academic life.

Mention the scholarships if you have received any or other types of awards
such as best student’s award, best debater’s award, award for poetry recitation,
extempore speech, sports and games and so on.

Experience: Here you should include experiences, if you have any, relevant to
the position you are applying for. You should show that you are a person who
can take initiative, has creativity and is innovative. You should be able to
convince the employers that you will be the best pick for the job.
Extracurricular activities: If you are writing a professional, and not an academic
CV, you should mention activities/programmes you have attended/participated
in.

Language Skills: You should also mention your level of competence in any
language you know in all the four skills, i.e. whether you are average, good, very
good or excellent in Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening in the languages
you know. 5

Computer skills: Write if you know—Microsoft word or anything else of
computer.
Hobbies: List your hobbies if space is left on the page. They look fine on a CV,
showing that you are not a no-life workaholic, but a normal person. You can
introduce other headings that suit your needs. Have a references section,
where you should list contact details of 2 or 3 persons who would write letters
of recommendation or reference letters for you. These are the usual components
of a CV. Print the CV on plain-white paper. You should never send a CV without
a cover letter. If the advertisement does not say anything about a cover letter,
you still should send one. Send the CV with covering letter in a matching
Ad size envelope.
Activity 1
Refer to the guideline of CV writing above, and answer the following
questions:

i) Why is a CV important?

ii) What is the basic purpose of writing a CV?

ii) What points should be included ina Cv?

16 E-mails 16/1: How to Write

We write and send various types of e-mails every day. They may be friendly,

professional, resumes, planning for events etc. Writing an effective e-mail is

indeed very important.

How to get attention

It is important to get the receiver to read your e-mail; it is also important to get

the e-mail noticed by the receiver, and then keep the receiver engaged till s/he

finishes reading it. Here are some tips for you for writing an effective e-mail.

Five tips for writing an effective e-mail

1. Clear purpose: It is important to know the purpose of your e-mail. The

receiver should be sure about the point.

2. Use the subject line wisely: Take the time to select a meaningful,

straightforward subject line that tells the reason for the e-mail clearly.

3. Make sure your identity: There are many cases where e-mails are ignored or

bypassed because the receiver is not familiar with the sender of the e-mail.

Take time to make sure that your full name is placed as the sender so that the

receiver will know who you are.

Avoid using initials or nicknames as many people tend to ignore e-mails that

are not sent with whole names which they can recognize.

4. Get to the point: Make sure your e-mails are concise.

People want to know what the e-mail is

about as soon as they open it. After a brief © 4

’ Bea

greeting followed by a comma, make sure

the next few lines are related specifically to

the subject of the e-mail.
S

--- Page 238 ---
E-mails 233
If this is a reply to another e-mail, reply immediately to any questions posed in
the original e-mail.

When composing the e-mail do not use unnecessary words. Short sentences
and paragraphs are better than long ones. Use an active voice such as "We are
sending your order today" instead of "Your order will be sent by us today."

5. Make sure your e-mail is readable: There is nothing more annoying than an
e-mail that cannot be read for various reasons, whether it’s because of poor
grammar or spelling, or the use of inappropriate fonts and abbreviations, or
even worse, an e-mail written in bright colors or all capital letters. It is always
best to use the proper format when sending an e-mail.

Check your e-mail text before sending it, and keep the formatting simple.

Put a blank line between paragraphs.

Remember: An e-mail is a form of communicatien; it is not a piece of artwork.
Why e-mails are bypassed

After you send your e-mail, you might not receive an answer for a number of
reasons.

In many cases, important e-mails are sometimes bypassed because the receiver
simply looks at the subject and decides that it is not worth reading, or puts the
e-mail aside for later reading (which may, or may not, happen!). This can be a
problem if the information within the e-mail is essential.

To avoid e-mails being bypassed or deleted just follow the five key points. You
will get the attention of the receiver.

17 Short 17/1: Characteristics
Composition: and Types of
Paragraphs Paragraphs

You have done a good deal of work on paragraph writing up to Class 8. Now

reflect on your previous experience and note down what you understand about

the following:
1. What is a paragraph?
2. What are the characteristics of a paragraph?

Activity 1

Read the following text and then answer the questions that follow.

in the dinosaur age the earth was infested by dinosaurs of different shapes and

sizes. Some dinosaurs were very huge; they were heavier than dozen elephants.

Some dinosaurs walked on powerful hind legs and stood as tall as paim trees.

Still others had short legs, square bodies and were as big as army tanks. These

dinosaurs had long horns and ugly, hooked beaks. Dinosaurs were so strange

and terrible that other animals ran away from them in fright. The dinosaur age
ended with the extinction of dinosaurs.
a What is the main idea of the passage?
b Which sentence states the main or the topic idea?
c Are the other sentences related to the main idea? Does the
passage give an impression of unity or oneness?

The passage is an example of a paragraph.

Now read the passage below and note down the points made about a

paragraph and its characteristics.

A paragraph is a unit of written discourse {may be spoken discourse also). It may

be self contained i.e. complete in itself, or may be used as part of a longer

discourse such as an essay or other assignments. The main idea of a

well-written paragraph is usually expressed in one sentence. This is called the

., ‘topic sentence. Then the idea is developed sentence by sentence. It is usually
5] made up of a number of logically connected sentences written on one single


--- Page 243 ---
238 English Grammar and Composition
topic. Each sentence of a paragraph should be closely related to the topic, and
the paragraph should have a good structure with a beginning, middle and end.
An effective paragraph, according to Donald et al (1978) should have 3 major
characteristics which are:
= It develops one idea only, called the controlling idea or thesis
statement.
+ It should have sufficient details to support the controlling idea.
+ It should have a beginning, a middle, and an end, that is, it requires a
topic sentence, a body to develop the topic sentence and a conclusion.
+“ The beginning or topic sentence introduces the topic or subject of the
paragraph.
% The middle or body develops and provides support to the topic or
thesis statement.
+“ The conclusion or end sums up and reaches a conclusion about the
topic/subject.
Activity 2
Discuss in pairs or groups what the above text says about paragraph and its
characteristics.
Activity 3
Read the following texts and see which one is a paragraph and which one is
not. Explain why you think so.
Text A
Besides care for personal appearance, he should pay close attention to his
manner of talking and finally, an applicant must show self confidence. For a
successful interview, an applicant should demonstrate some qualities. The
applicant should be elegantly, not too casually or too gorgeously, dressed.

Paragraphs can be classified in various ways. In essays paragraphs are classified
into introductory, development, transitional, summarizing etc, types.
Depending on the purpose of the writer, on the other hand, paragraphs may be
classified into persuasive, argumentative, descriptive, narrative etc, types.
According to techniques of development they can be classified into cause and
effect, contrast, comparison, definition etc. types In short, these are the major
classifications of paragraphs.

Activity 4

The following sentences are not in proper order to form a coherent
paragraph. Rearrange them in a logical order. Put a number in the bracket
against each sentence according to the sequence you would like to arrange
them in.

( ) Last Friday was a frustrating day.

( } But my father called me and asked me to type a few official letters for him
before | went.

( ) It was my aunt from next door calling to check if | could give her some
time.

( ) It was a beautiful, warm and sunny day. | decided to go out and enjoy the
lovely weather.

( ) When | finished typing, | got up quickly and hurried towards the door.

( )1got dressed, took my fishing rod, and got my bicycle out to go fishing.

( ) When | got back home, the sun had already set. | was still dressed to go
fishing, and the cycle and the fishing rod were there leaning against the
gate.

( ) Just at that moment, the door bell rang.

{ ) She needed me to take her to the hospital.

{ ) Her daughter, my cousin, has just given birth to a baby boy.

{ ) As took the cycle and the fishing rod inside the house | realized that |

i
g had spent the day doing things | never thought I'd do.


--- Page 245 ---
240 English Grammar and Composition
( ) I left the fishing rod and the cycle standing against a wall in the courtyard,
ready to go the moment | would finish typing the letters.
Activity 5
Look at the sentences below. They do not fit into one paragraph. They refer to
two different topics. Separate the sentences for two different paragraphs and
rearrange them into two logically connected paragraphs.
« My first day in the new school was difficult.
+ There were some benches and an outdoor oven in the picnic area.
+ Inthe National Park of Shalna we found perfect setting for our picnic.
« | got stuck in the traffic jam and reached school fifteen minutes late.
+ Everyone had gone to class and | found no one to ask for direction.
* Nearby we found a football field, and not further away, a big pond
where some of my friends went swimming immediately. .
* Twice | was embarrassed when | walked into classroom that was not
mine.
» Behind the picnic area was a forest where some of us went for a walk
after lunch.
+ The building was so huge that it was hard to find my classroom.
« Finally, | decided to go into my classroom
+ When | ultimately got to my class, | was almost in tears.
= We liked the place so much that as we rode home on bus, we agreed to
have next year's picnic in the same spot
Types of Paragraphs
There are many types of paragraphs. The major types are:
Descriptive paragraph Narrative paragraph Cause and Effect paragraph
Comparison paragraph Contrast paragraph Expository paragraph
Argumentative paragraph Persuasive paragraph Listing paragraph
Some of these types are dealt with elaborately from lesson 3 onward. 5

17/2: Topic Sentence
Writing an effective topic sentence
A good topic sentence introduces the topic to be developed in a paragraph. It
controls or limits the focus of paragraph, and once the focus is mentioned,
there is no scope to go outside it. Anything outside its scope will be redundant
or unnecessary. On the other hand, if the paragraph does not sufficiently
support the topic statement that proves another weakness of a paragraph.
Remember that although the topic sentence usually comes at the beginning of
a paragraph, it may sometimes come at the end or even in the middle of the
paragraph. Sometimes the main idea of a paragraph can be so obvious that it
need not be stated explicitly.
Activity 1
Read the following paragraph from a thank-you note and then answer the
questions that follow.
You have made everybody in our family happy by giving me the raincoat. Sonia
is happy because she won't have to lend me her raincoat again. Mother is
happy because we have stopped arguing over who is going to use the one
raincoat we have had. Father is happy because he doesn’t have to buy one now.
Even old grandpa is happy because now the house is quiet and he can sleep
peacefully. | am the happiest person of all because you gave me a wonderful
gift.

c How do all the other sentences add up to explain the main idea of
the topic sentence?

Activity 2

In each of the following paragraphs, the topic sentence is missing. Supply

the topic sentence for each.

a. Tourist Spots in Bangladesh
The first and most important tourist attraction in the country is Cox’s Bazar
sea beach, which is the longest sea beach in the world that has a sloping
sandy beach where people can go swimming and have sun baths. One can
also go for drive long the beach. The hilly area beside the beach has a
wonderful natural beauty. The scene of sun-rising and sunset seen from
the beach have unique beauties of their own that can only be felt, and
difficult to express in language. The second attraction for tourists in
Bangladesh is the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest of the world.
The dense and tall tropical forest is remarkable for its natural beauty. The
streams running through the forest, and its habitats, the Royal Bengal
tigers, striped deer and other animals make it one of the world heritage
sites of the world. Kuakata beach of Barishal and Patenga beach of

Chattogram are some other places of natural beauty worth visiting in
Bangladesh. The country has many other scenes and sights worth visiting
for local and foreign tourists.

b. Developments in Rural Transport System

A revolution has taken place in the rural transport sector in Bangladesh.
About a decade or so ago, there were hardly any mechanized mode of
transport in the rural areas; people had to walk long distances. Students
used to walk three four miles to go to school and another three four
miles of walking back home from school. Farmers used to carry their
goods either on their heads or by bullock or buffalo driven carts. But
with the improvement of roads in the rural areas, non-conventional
mechanized transports are seen frequently moving along the roads,
carrying both people and goods. This mechanized transport system that
includes engine driven vans, tempos, auto-rickshaw and the like have
changed the face of rural Bangladesh. The farmers can easily market
their products by using these transports. It has brought mobility in rural
life and it is largely contributing to the economic growth of Bangladesh.
Thus it is noticed that very significant change has taken place in the rural
transport system of Bangladesh.

17/3: Descriptive Paragraph

Description is that kind of writing that pictures a place, a person, or an object.
In learning to write description, you should sharpen your powers of observation
i.e. train your five senses- sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste. Try to picture
for your reader the people, places or objects you are familiar with and have
observed carefully. This will help you describe them vividly by using details that
would appeal to your reader.
When you write a descriptive paragraph, tell who or what you are describing in
your topic sentence. Here is an example for you. Read the paragraph below and
look for details that appeal to the senses.
Activity 1
Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow:
The rainstorm was becoming more intense. Outside the wind roared and
raindrops splashed against the window panes. The wind rattled the windows
and slammed the shutters against the front of the house. Water began to drip
from the living-rcom ceiling in big noisy splashes. Then a loud burst of thunder
vibrated the house and made everybody jump. Five year old Rima hid her face
in her mother’s lap and began to cry.
Which details in the paragraph above help you hear sounds? Which help you
see the rain?
Activity 2
A good paragraph helps the reader see something exactly as the writer sees it.
Think of details of your own to describe the following things. Try to use your
five senses: sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell.

a The clouds in Autumn, or in the rainy season

b The star fruit

¢ Your favourite flower, or your favourite food

Describing People

A Read the following extract taken from Ernest Hemingway's story, The
Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber:

Francis Macomber was very tall, very well built if you did not mind that
length of hone, dark, his hair cropped like an oarsman, rather
thin-lipped, and was considered handsome. He was dressed in the same
sort of safari clothes that Wilson wore except that his were new. He was
thirty-five years old, kept himself very fit.

Notice that the details in the above passage describe the physical
features and appearance of Francis Macomber.

B Now read the paragraph below from another story, The Capital of the
World, by the same author and see how it describes both the
appearance and some of the nature of the person being described:

i He was a well built boy with very black, rather curly hair, good teeth and
a skin that his sisters envied, and he had a ready and unpuzzled smile. He
was fast on his feet and did his work well and loved his sisters, who
seemed beautiful and sophisticated; ..... and he loved his work.

Cc Read the following paragraph and notice how the topic sentence
expresses the main idea of the topic, i.e. my little sister acts like my big
sister. And then notice how this is developed through illustrations or
examples in the following sentences:

My little sister might as well be called my big sister. I'm twenty years old,
and Urmila is only twelve. But Urmila acts like a sixty year old lady, not
only with me but with everyone else in the house. She is regularly
advising my father on what to wear, what to eat, when to take rest. My
mother merely smiles when Urmila advises her on what to cook for the
day or if the curry was a little too salty. Maybe we all pamper her a little,

and accept her adult acting. But last month when | came down with the
flu, | realized how precious she was to me. She sat beside me all the
time, putting an ice-bag on my forehead, bringing me water and fruit
juice to drink and often, in her usual manner, scolding me if | did not take
medicine on time. And all through those days she tried to cheer me up
by telling me the “little stories” of her life. That one time she really was
my ‘big” sister.

Activity 3

Write a paragraph on a brother or sister (or any close relation) of yours. Write

a topic sentence telling the reader about a characteristic thing of his or her

nature. Then write sentences to develop that idea.

Activity 4

Write a paragraph describing your best friend. You can describe some features

of his/her appearance as well as some aspects of his/her nature, or can

describe just one of the two.

Describing a Place

D Read the following paragraph in which the writer is describing a street
in the early morning as he or she sees it.

A Street in Early Morning

In the early morning streets are scenes of serene beauty. I live on the eighth

floor of a high-rise building by a very busy street in Dhaka city. But in the early

morning the street wears a very different look. When I get up early, | often stand

on the balcony overlooking the street. The sun has just come up and its light

bathes the whole street with a golden glow. The street lights, after the night's

vigilance, say goodbye as they are turned off. On the footpath the street dogs

that were awake all night curl up for a bit of sleep. On the other side of the
2 street, a few unfortunate homeless people pull up their torn bed sheets to

shade them from the sun and go back to sleep again. A car, with its headlights

still on, rolls by slowly as if sorry to disturb the morning calm. A few rickshaw
pullers paddle their vehicles slowly towards no particular destination. A tea stall
lights its fire and the smoke from it fills the quiet morning with heavenly mists.
A light breeze brushes my face as | stand there enjoying the serene beauty,
trying not to think of the noise and hustle of the day that will surely follow in a
few short minutes.

Activity 5

Write a paragraph describing a busy city street.

E Here is another descriptive paragraph. Read the paragraph and find
out the topic sentence, developers and terminator or concluding
sentence in it.

a) Rural Life in Bangladesh
The majority of the people of Bangladesh live in the rural areas. People live a
very plain and simple life. Majority of the rural people are farmers. They work
on their lands and earn their livelihood by cultivating their own land or working
on other people's land. They work hard from morning till night. Some of the
farmers are quite well-to-do, but there are many landless people also. The
affluent people of the rural community send their children to schools, colleges
and universities, but the poorer section cannot afford their children’s
education. In most cases, their children become child labourers. They work as
day labourers in other peoples houses or turn rickshaw or van drivers. These
days, most of them can, however, earn enough to manage two square meals a
day. Some of them go to the nearby towns and cities to work as rickshaw
pullers, garments workers, taxi or auto-rickshaw drivers. Whatever is the
amount of money they earn, they are happy with what they have. These days
the rural people have modern facilities of life too. Most houses have electricity,
television; the rich people also have refrigerators, improved sanitation system. g

17/4: Narrative Paragraph
The purpose of narration is story telling. Narrative paragraphs narrate or tell
about some past incidents or events. The simplest kind of story is the kind of
writing that tells us about a series of actions, usually in time order, in a single
paragraph. A good narrative paragraph often tells us not only ‘what happened”
but also ‘how it happened’. While writing a narrative paragraph you should
keep in mind the following guidelines:
a present the subject in a topic sentence
b include information about the people and the setting
c tell the action in chronological order
d use transitional words, such as, first, soon, next, then, later, etc.
e write a concluding sentence to bring the incident te a definite end i

Here are some examples of narrative paragraphs.
A Horrible Childhood Memory
Some of the past memories are not forgettable. Here | narrate one such
memory of my life. | remember a fateful day when my friend, Sameer,
almost got drowned. During our summer holidays, our school was closed.
There was a big pond close to our home. My friends and | often went there
to take our bath and have a swim. On that bright colourless summer day |
had gone with my two friends, Sameer and Arif, to the pond. We got into
water, swam for a while and were thoroughly enjoying ourselves. At one
stage, when we were quite far away from the bank | heard Sameer cry out
for help. He was going under water. At first | thought he was making fun, but
soon | realized that there was something wrong. | saw Arif swimming
toward Sameer. But Sameer was drowning, his body was under water. We
could not find him. It was a serious situation; everybody was tensed. | was
puzzled and could not decide what to do. Then | swam towards the bank
and cried out to the passerby to do something to rescue Sameer. Hearing
my shouts a young man rushed to the spot, took off his shirt and jumped
into the pond within moments. He dived into the water, searched for
Sameer a few times, and after about five minutes found him and brought
him on the surface, and carried him to the bank in an unconscious state. We
were still not sure about his condition. Then he shook Sameer in a special
way for sometimes. After about 40 minutes Sameer had some movement
and opened his eyes. It was a terrible experience of my life.
My First Day at School
1 still remember my first day at school. A few months before | was taken to
school, there was a kind of preparation in the family for helping me start a
new chapter of my life, my school life. A new dress was tailored, a new bag
and a few new bocks were purchased. (In)On a fine morning in January, my
grandmother and my mother dressed me up for school, hanged my school
bag with the books inside at my back, and my grandfather, who was
g excessively fond of me, held me by my hand and led me to school. It was

primary school about half a mile away from our home, not very far, but |
had never been there before. From a distance | could hear the noise of the
students learning their lessons in a loud voice, and there was a sound like
the singing of a chorus. When I reached the school, | saw a large number of
boys and girls sitting in five different clusters, each cluster was a class. |
could see them all, as there was no partition to separate the classes. | was
afraid to see so many boys and girls, and the noise they were making.
Moreover, the teachers were quite old and seemed rather unfriendly to me.
My grandfather took me to the Head Teacher for admission, completed
some formalities, gave me some advice and left me in the school. But five
minutes after my grandfather had left, | felt so helpless among these
strangers that | decided not to continue. Within moments, | took my bag
and started running after my grandfather. | managed to overtake him in a
few minutes, but he was surprised to see me thus run away from school. He
tried to take me back to the school, but | started crying piteously. This
moved my grandfather, who carried me back home. When | think of this
now, it provokes laughter.

Road accident is a regular phenomenon in Bangladesh. Many people die of
road accidents every year; many others become permanently disabled, so it
is considered a curse. Road accidents occur for various reasons. Many
factors are responsible for road accidents. The most common cause is
drivers without driving license. Many of the drivers in Bangladesh do not
have driving license. Even if there is a driver with license, sometimes the
conductors drive and the licensed driver take rest. Secondly, some of the
drivers drive very recklessly and they try to overtake, which in most cases
are one of the major causes of road accidents. Thirdly, many of the drivers
overwork. They drive by day, and sometimes they drive night coach also on
the same day, which cause much fatigue and the drivers feel sleepy which
may cause serious accidents. Fourthly, mechanical troubles such as break
failure, also cause accidents. The drivers, in many cases, do not properly
check the engines before they start driving. Fifthly, there are too many
buses on the roads. Moreover the roads are two-lane roads without any
dividers. So, sometimes there are head-on collisions and sometimes the
buses skid off the roads. There are other reasons also, but these are some
of the major reasons of road accidents in Bangladesh.

2. Causes of Students’ Failure in Examination
Many students fail in different public examinations every year. There are
many causes of students’ failure. The main cause is lack of students’ interest
in some subjects. Students do not enjoy learning and the system cannot
make learning interesting. The major motivation is to pass and get a good
grade, but beyond that, they do not seem interested in learning things for
their relevance in life. Students’ motivation to learning is very poor.
Another important reason for students’ failure is that the content students
are required to deal with does not seem to have any relevance for their
practical and professional life. Third important reason for failure of
students is that they study seasonally before the exams and neglect their
studies throughout the year. Moreover, teachers in the country are not
skilled enough to motivate the students and make their learning an
interesting experience. Besides, a need-based curriculum, as well as
meaningful and interesting textbooks for learners would improve the
situation significantly. However, without skilled teachers nothing would
take place as we desire.

3. Causes of the Spread of English as a Global Language
English has emerged as the major international language of the world. The
importance of English has increased many times in the present world. There
are many reasons for this. Firstly, interdependence of nations in the world
has also increased after World War |i, for trade and commerce and for many
other purposes. Secondly, people are moving from one country to another
for education, tourism, diplomatic and other reasons. A common language
is required for interaction among people from different countries and
contexts, who speak different languages. Without a common language it is
difficult to perform different activities at the international level. English has

Short Composition : Paragraphs 255
assumed the position of that common language. Thirdly, it has also become
the major library language of the world, as most of the library books in the
world are in English. Education of international standard is not possible
without good command of English as most of the books and journals in
libraries all over the world are in English. Fourthly, English is also the
language of technology. It is difficult to live in the present world without
computers, internet, facebook, twitter etc, which are used globally by
people across borders and English is the dominant language for those.
These are some of the major causes of the emergence of English as a
global/international language.

Notice that each of the above paragraphs begins with a statement of the

effect as topic sentence and then in the body of the paragraphs, the causes

are given.

Listing paragraph provides a list of items in support of the topic sentence.
The following paragraph provides a list of the major fruits of Bangladesh.
Fruits of Bangladesh

In Bangladesh, many kinds of fruits are available, and the fruit market in the
country also is expanding. Firstly, the name that comes to our mind is
mango which is the most popular and tasty fruit grown in plenty in different
districts of the country. Another very popular and tasty fruit is the leeches
which also grows abundantly in some northern districts of Bangladesh. The
third popular fruit is the jack fruit which is also our national fruit. Fourthly
we can mention bananas which too is very delicious and nutritious that
grows in plenty in most of the districts in Bangladesh. Fifthly, the name of
guava, which is very rich in vitamin C is available round the year. Among
other fruits, we can mention orange, pineapple, apple which used to be
imported in our country, but now growing in some regions of our country.
Now Fruits are available in all the seasons, but some fruits are available in
some specific seasons. Foreign fruits such as apple, orange and thelike are also
grown in Bangladesh now and they are available round the year. People in
the country are becoming increasingly fond of fruits, so growing fruits has
also become lucrative for the growers also.

Stages of Bangladesh Education System
Education system of Bangladesh has few distinct stages. The first stage is
the pre-primary stage which comprises the two years of nursery school
education. The second step, which is the first official step in the country, is
the primary level that comprises classes | to 5 and now ends with Primary
Education Completion (PEC) Examination. The next step is the Junior School
level which comprises three years of education from Class 6 to class 8 and
ends with Junior School Certificate (JSC) Examination. The fourth step,
officially third step according to the new Education Policy 2010, is
secondary education that includes two years from class IX to class X and
ends with Secondary School Certificate (5.5.C) .The fifth step is the Higher
Secondary level education for two years and includes classes Xl and XII and
ends with Higher Secondary Certificate (H.5.C) Examination. The next step is
Higher education that comprises 4 years of Bachelor's (Honours) degree
and one year Master's degree, or 3 years of Bachelor's (pass) degree
followed by two years’ Master's degree. After these levels, there are also
research programs for M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees, These are the different
stages of the education system in Bangladesh.
Literary Genres/Forms
There are a number of major literary genres marked by their distinctive
characteristics. First, Poetry is a major genre of literature marked by
connotative, suggestive or ornamental use of language, rhyme, and rhythm.
This makes poetry different from other genres of literature. Poetry again
has sub-genres like lyric, sonnet, elegy, epic etc. Another major genre of
literature is drama or play which is written both in prose and verse. Drama
is primarily a performing art, not a narrative art, and is meant to be staged
in a theatre. It is composed in dialogue, and is marked by action of the
actors and actresses. Drama has subgenres like tragedy, comedy,
tragi-comedy and history plays. The third major genre of literature is fiction
Forma-33, English Grarnmar and Compasition, 3-10

258 English Grammar and Compasition
which is a narrative art, written usually in prose, has one or more narrators
telling the story/stories. Fiction has sub-genres like novel and short story.
The fourth genre of literature is non-fiction prose. Creative writers in all
ages and all countries have tried their hands in all these genres and
entertained readers of all ages with their writings.

17/7: Comparison Paragraph
This type of paragraphs shows similarities between two persons, places, things,
objects, actions or ideas. The topic sentence shows how we are comparing the
features or qualities of two subjects. To use this technique, we can have two
procedures:
a) We can compare two subjects’ features or qualities point by point, or
b) We can state all the features or qualities of a subject first and then
compare these with those of the other subject.
Read the following paragraphs and see how it has been developed. Notice its
topic sentence, development and conclusion.
A Paragraph and an Essay
Despite differences in length, a paragraph and an essay have a number of
similarities. Firstly, a paragraph has a beginning which is the topic sentence
that introduces the topic. Similarly, an essay has a beginning called the
introduction which also introduces the key idea(s) of the essay. Secondly, a 4
~


--- Page 264 ---
Short Composition : Paragraphs 259
paragraph has a body comprised of a few sentences called the developers
which develop the idea introduced in the topic sentence. Similarly, an essay
also has a body comprised of some paragraphs that develop the idea
introduced in the introduction of the essay. A paragraph has a terminator
or concluding sentence that logically draws the idea of the paragraph to a
logical conclusion by restating the idea of the topic sentence. Similarly, in an
essay, the concluding paragraph sums up the idea of the essay and
concludes with reference to the idea(s) in the introductory paragraph. In
addition to these, both have a sense of unity. The different sentences in a
paragraph contribute to one idea stated in the topic sentence and thus
create a sense of unity; the different paragraphs of an essay, similarly,
contribute to the central argument of an essay. Thus a paragraph and an
essay are largely similar structurally.

Read one more paragraph of comparison. Comment on its development

A Short Story and a Novel

Although different in length, a short story and a novel have many
similarities. Both belong to the category of literature known as fiction; they
are fictitious. Both of them have a story outline or plot. A short story has a
setting, both time and space settings; similarly a novel also has time and
space settings which contribute te the meaning or theme. Both are
narrative arts and have story teller to tell the story. Both are written in
prose. Both the genres have some characters, and episodes and both have
themes. Thus, a short story and a novel have many similarities.

17/8: Contrast Paragraph
Contrast paragraphs show the differences between two things.
A Here is an example of a paragraph which presents a contrast between
the stars and the planets.
Stars and Planets
Although stars and planets shine in the night sky, they differ from one
another in many ways. In fact, most of the shinning lights in the sky are balls
of fire called stars. We do not feel their heat because they are very, very far
from us. Our sun is a star. The planets, on the other hand, are balls of cold
gas or solid rocks, and revolve round the stars. Our Earth is a planet that
goes round the star sun. Mars is another planet that revolves around the
sun. Stars come in different sizes and colours. The new stars are
bluish-white in colour. Often their heat is so intense that they look white
and are called “White Dwarfs”. Then there are large stars that have burnt
most of their fuel and are red in colour. They are often so big that astronauts
call them “Red Giants”. Like stars, planets also vary in size and colour. Our
Earth is a small planet compared to Jupiter, which is a ball of gas, many
hundreds of times larger than Earth. The Earth looks blue, the Mars is red,
while the Jupiter is orange.
B Read the following example of a contrast paragraph and see how it
begins, develops and ends.
Summer and Winter in Bangladesh
Summer and winter are two contrasting seasons of Bangladesh. Each has its
own characteristics that distinguish it from the other. Summer is
constituted of the months of May and June; winter, on the other hand, is
constituted of the months of December and January, as it really happens
these days. Summer is very hot and humid season. Temperature shoots up be

to 45 degree Celsius sometimes in some places of the country. During the
noon time, the roads become empty in the towns and cities as people are
afraid to go out in the sun. Sometimes people have heat stroke when they
work under the scorching heat of summer. The humidity causes profuse
sweating. On the contrary, winter is a very cold season; sometimes mercury
goes down to 3 or 4 degree Celsius in some places of the country. Often
there is dense fog in winter, and it continues for 3 to 5 days. The sun is not
visible for those days. Summer is the season of delicious local fruits like
mango, jack fruit and guava among others, whereas, winter is a season of
vegetables and flowers of different types. Thus the two seasons of
Bangladesh, summer and winter, are marked by distinctive differences.

Cc Here are two more examples of contrast paragraph. Read these and
notice their organization. See what differences between the two topics
in each paragraph are mentioned.

A Novel and a Drama
A novel and a drama are two different genres of literature with distinctly
different features, The first is a narrative art that has story and one or more
story tellers. It is written in prose. But drama is an action, not a narrative. It
is written in dialogue and the characters act out these dialogues on the
stge. It is a performing art. A drama is not a drama unless it is acted out on
the stage. Drama has an audience, but novel is meant for reading. The
narrator introduces and describes the characters in a novel, but in a drama
the characters are revealed through the action. Briefly these are some of
the major differences between a novel and a drama.
Objective Test and Essay Test
Objective test and essay test are two different types of test which focus on
different skills. Both have comparative merits and demerits also. An
objective test tries basically to test recognition and recall, some form of it
can test basic knowledge and understanding also, but it cannot test
analytical and logical thinking of the students and their originality and
creativity. Most common types of objective tests are MCQ tests, gap filling,
wy yes/no, true/false type questions etc. Objective tests are easy to score, even
5] machines can score objective tests. So scoring is highly reliable. Marks do


--- Page 267 ---
262 English Grammar and Composition
not vary among examiners for the same level of answers. Correct answer
will get full credits; wrong answers will be given no credit. So whoever the
examiner is from wherever, marking is reliable in this type of test. On the
other hand, essay tests focus on logical thinking, analytical skill and
creativity in presenting an idea, which are very important for all learners for
their intellectual development. However, marking is highly subjective in this
type of tests. Two examiners may award two different marks for the same
type of answers, or even the same examiner may award different marks far
the same level of answer if marking at two different times or on two
different days. Therefore, scoring of essay tests is not reliable. Thus the two
types of tests focus on different aspects, and both have their distinctive
merits and demerits and both are needed.

A A short composition describing a tour to Cox’s Bazar
After my final examination of class IX, our family which consists of 4
members only—my father, mother, elder sister and myself—decided to
go to Cox's Bazar. We sat together to plan our journey. We decided to
travel by train. We would take the 7 a.m. train to Dhaka, and the same
day we will take the afternoon train to Chattogram. Accordingly train
tickets were booked in advance.
On December 25, 2015 we started our journey from Rajshahi Railway
Station by Silk City Train. We had our seats in the AC chair coach. Ihada
front facing window-side seat from where | could look through the
window and see the scenes outside. The train journey was quite
comfortable. We took some food with us, and had our breakfast on the
train.
At 1.00 p.m. we reached Kamalapur Railway Station, Dhaka, but the
Chattegram train, Suborna Express was in the afternoon at 3.00 p.m. So,
we decided to take our lunch at Kamalapur Station. We went on the first E]

floor in a restaurant, rather a good restaurant with our bags. After lunch,
we came down to the platform where the Chattogram bound train was
supposed to leave. The train was on time. It came near the platform half
an hour before the scheduled time. We got into the train comfortably
and took our seats in AC chaircoach in this train too. It was a very
comfortable train.

The train started exactly at 3.00. After Noakhali we were excited to see
the scenic beauty of the region. We saw the small hills on both sides of
the train. As my sister and | never had been to this part of the country
before, we had not seen hills and mountains before. So it was a dream
coming true for us. We were really very excited. At 8.0 p.m. we reached
Chattogram station. We spent the night in our cousin's house. Chattegram
City captivated our heart. It is so beautiful. The houses on hill tops look
fascinating.
The next morning at 8.00 a.m., we tock a bus to Cox's Bazar. My sister
and | were amazed by the bewitching beauty of the natural scenery of
the hill stretching for miles. We, for the first time, saw that our lovely
country has such a beautiful landscape; the topography of the hilly
regions offers a contrast to the plain lands of the country. We reached
Cox's Bazar around 12 noon. We went to the hotel rooms which my
father reserved for us in a motel on the beach, called ‘Probal’. The motel
was just on the beach and from the hotel room, the sea was visible, and roars
of the sea were audible We decided to change our dresses and go to the
beach and take our lunch in a sea side hotel.
We went to the beach at 1.30. What a spectacular scene it was! The vast
expanse of the sea water in front of us, the big waves with foams and
roaring sounds rushing to the shore! We were just stunned by the
magnificence of nature!
We were in Cox's Bazar for two days. We spent most of the time during
5 the day on the beach, we walked along the shore, bathed in the sea,

spell on us. We could not realize how the two days were gone.

B Now read a short composition by an eminent person describing his
village.
| come from a village in the district of Pabna. It is about six miles east of
Pabna town and about ane kilometer north from Pabna —Sujanagar Road.

A One Pacca Road from Sujanagar Road goes through our village and at

one point in our village the road has another branch and both the

branches go through our village and through many other villages and

finally the roads meet Pabna Ataikula Road at two different points. The

village now has a touch of modernity. There are two bazars now on the

roads in three different places of the village. It takes only forty minutes

now to go to Pabna town, and to come home from the town. The villagers

now are dally trafficking to the town with motor cycles, bicycles, CNG and

auto-rickshaw. The non-mechanised and mechanised transport system in

the villages has changed the economy of the village. Mobility of the

people has improved significantly. The village has many graduates from

different public and private universities of the country. Many of them are

working in government offices, non-government organizations and

banks.

The villagers still depend largely on agriculture. However, the entire

village has irrigation schemes with deep and shallow tube wells. Most of

the villagers work in their fields during day time, and in the evening they

sit in front of television sets in the bazars and watch various satellite

channels together. Most of the houses have television, many have

refrigerators. The houses are mostly tin shed houses. There are some

buildings as well. The economic condition of the people are good now.

The landless people also can earn enough to meet their daily expenses.

Even the day labourers now send their children to school. F<

Short Composition 269
The village has two primary and one high school. Many boys and girls
read in these schools. The schools have changed the face of the village.
Our girls can easily study up to the S.5.C level almost free of cost. In every
house we have qualified girls now. Many of these girls are studying in the
major universities of the country.

The village has a wonderful scenic beauty. During season, the lands are
full of green crops which present a wonderful sight. To the north of the
village, there is a big beel area, which these days do not have much water,
and so has become the hub of paddy production. The entire village is full
of trees. People have developed an interest in tree plantation. There are
some mango orchards, small ones though. People also grow seasonal
crops and vegetables, very fresh, and green vegetables.
Majority of the people are now economically solvent. Some people are in
business. The businessmen seem to be economically well of. However,
there is a kind of friendliness and fellow feelings amongst the villagers.
Boys and girls play together. They organize cultural and sports activities in
the village. One drama is staged annually by our club, Ansar Smriti
Sangha. The club organises some sports and games competition every
year, There is often a football competition, volleyball competition,
badminton championship, ludu, carrom and some other indoor sports
competition. At one side of the village there is a very large and beautiful
graveyard. People from the nearby villages bury their dead in this
graveyard.
The villagers have fellow feeling for each other; they have a good
bonding. They help each other in times of need. If anybody is maltreated
by outsiders, the entire village comes forward and stand beside the
distressed man. For wedding and other social occasions, they organize
big parties for the villagers. They stand beside each other in their weal
and woe. The village has the most shaping influence on me. | now live in
a city, and am lost in the busy schedule of professional responsibilities,
but the memories of my early life in the village are always fresh with me
Gi and beckons me to visit it. So | visit my village and my relations still living

My Mother's Village
(From N.C. Chaudhury’s Autobiography of an Unknown Indian)
To pass from Banagram (where the writer's ancestral home was located)
to my mother’s village, Kalikachcha or Kalikutch, was to pass into a
world so different, so humble, so full of humility, and so self effacing in
bamboo and cane greenery, that it brought tears to one’s eyes...The
country round Kalikutch was open, but the village itself was thickly
wooded, in places so thickly as to have the appearance of a tropical
forest. It was only at Kalikutch on our side of East Bengal that | saw thick
undergrowth at the foot of tall trees, climbers of all sports and cane
clinging to them, and bamboo, reed, and scrub all jumbled together.
Sometimes through small gaps in the bushes we could see real wild cats
(Felis Chaus), not merely the domestic cat become feral. These animals
at times stared at us very gravely, at times dozed without paying us the
slightest heed, and at times also caterwauled. The distance within
which we considered it safe to approach them was never less than one
hundred yards. So after all there was not much occasion for the cats to
take us very seriously.
There were also patches of wood which were mere open, and through
them we could see the sun rise and set with bizare effect, looking very
big against the tree trunks which took the appearance of dark and thick
stripes on its body. Besides the woods, there was almost everywhere
about us some water-way, marsh, pond, pool, or tank. The tanks were
mostly, but not in every case, in tolerable condition. That could not ,
however, be said of the other domiciles of water. They were all choked
with weed and smelt of rotting vegetation. The water of the little pond
in which we washed our mouths after meals was of the colour of lightly
brewed tea without its pleasant smell. The smell of the water was of the
vegetation just mentioned. The great attractions of this pond were the
moaor-hens and water-hens, whose calls we always heard but whom we
rarely saw. Even when we saw them it was only a glimpse of fluttering
wings that we caught. o

We all like to listen to stories. But it is not always easy when it comes to telling
or writing a story well. It requires a lot of planning and organization in building
up the plot and the characters.
There are some common techniques of telling a good story. For example, how
you begin it, how you carry the story forward, and how you end it. Before you
start to write a story, you must have the whole plot clear in your mind, and the
main points arranged in their proper order.
Read the following story, one of Aesop’s well-known fables, and see how the
story has developed.
The Seven Sticks
Long ago and far away, there was an old farmer who had seven sons. When he
thought that he was about to die, he gathered his sons about him. He told a
servant to bring in a bundle of seven sticks tied together. Handing the bundle
to his oldest son, the father said to him, “Now break the bundle”.
The son tried with all his might, but he could not break the bundle. One by
ane, the other brothers tried. None of them was strong enough.
The father smiled, “Now, my sons, untie the bundle. Each of you take a stick
and try to break it.” This time they had no difficulty doing as their father bid
them. In a few moments all the sticks were broken.
“In unity there is strength,” said the father.
Activity 1
Following are some hints for another of Aesop’s very well-known fables. The
moral of the story is, “Where there’s a will, there’s a way”. Try to complete
the story by filling in more details. Use the moral in the right place of the
story.

Summaries

A summary is a restatement of someone else's words in your own words.
There are many different kinds of summaries, and they vary according to the
degree to which you interpret or analyze the source. Some are pages long,
while others are just one or two sentences. However, for all types of summary,
the writer is responsible for generally stating, in his or her own words, the
main information or argument of another writer.
Purposes of the Summary
Summaries benefit the reader because they offer a concise, general version of
the original information. For a busy reader, summaries provide quick
overviews of material. Summaries also show readers that you have
understood the general point of a text, and in this way, teachers can test your
knowledge. The process of summarizing someone else's material enables you
to understand that material better.
What and When to Summarize
Many student writers tend to quote when they should summarize material.
Quote only when the author expresses a point in a particularly telling or
interesting language. Otherwise, simply summarize. Use a summary to restate
an entire argument. Use a summary to present information.

278 English Grammar and Composition
How to Summarize

+ Read the original passage or text very carefully.

« Use a pencil to highlight or underline what you take to be the main
point/points of the original text, or make notes in the margins or on
another sheet of paper.

« If you're summarizing an entire essay, outline the writer's arguments.

+ These notes and outlines should be brief. Using this list of points, you
write down the summary, referring to the original text only when you
want to make sure of some point. This will help you to reproduce the
substance of the passage in your own words.

Summary Conventions

« Summaries can range in length from two sentences to several pages.
What you have to remember is that when you write a summary of
something you have read, you make your summary shorter than the
original. Usually a summary is one third of the original in length, i.e. if a
passage is of 150 words, the summary of it would be about 50 words
long.

« In any case, use complete sentences to present the main points or
information the text you are describe an author's general points to the
reader. Don't quote extensively. If you quote, use quotation marks and
document the quotation. If you fail to document the quotation, even
one word that the author used, you are plagiarizing material
(presenting another person's information as if it were your own).

The Lion and the Mouse
A lion was sleeping in his den one day, when a mischievous mouse for no
reason at all ran across the outstretched paw and up the royal nose of the king
of beasts, awakening from his nap. The mighty beast clapped his paw upon the
nose thoroughly frightened little creature and would have made an end of
him.
“Please,” squealed the mouse, “Don’t kill me. Forgive me this time, Q King, and
I shall never forget it. A day may come, who knows, when | may do you a good
turn to repay your kindness.” The lion smiling at his little prisoner's fright and
amused by the thought that so small a creature ever could be of assistance to
the king of beasts, let him go.
Not long afterward the lion, while ranging the forest for his prey, was caught in
the net which the hunters had set to catch him. He let out a roar that echoed
through the forest. Even the mouse heard it, and recognizing the voice of his
former preserver and friend, ran to the spot where he lay tangled in the net of
ropes.

“Well, your majesty”, said the mouse, “I know you did not believe me once
when | said | would return a kindness, but here is my chance.” And without
further ado he set to work to nibble with his sharp little teeth at the ropes that
bound the lion. Soon the lion was able to crawl out of the hunter's snare and
be free. (254 words)
Now read the summary:
Once, a playful mouse ran across the paw and up the nose of a sleeping lion.
The lion awoke, caught the mouse, and was about to kill him when the mouse
begged forgiveness, saying he might one day return the kindness. Amused, the
lion released him. Soon afterward, the lion was caught in a net set by hunters.
The mouse heard the lion’s roar, recognized his friend's voice, and came to
help. His sharp teeth cut the ropes, setting the lion free. {82 words)
Note: The writer of a summary must be able to tell the difference between a
main idea and a minor idea. In the above fable, the idea that the lion was
caught in a net is essential to the story, and is therefore, a main idea. But it is
not necessary or essential to know that when the lion was caught, or that he
had been ranging the forest for his prey.
Here is a one sentence summary of the fable:
A mouse, whose life had once been spared by a lion, later returned the
kindness by freeing the lion from a hunter’s net.

Writing Summaries 281
We read different kinds of material in different ways. We don't always read
everything at the same speed. With certain kinds of material we need to read
slowly and carefully, for example, when we are trying to understand difficult
ideas in a text like science or economics books. We also read directions and
instructions slowly and carefully. We usually read stories, magazines,
newspapers, where the material is usually written in an easily understandable
way, at a normal speed, neither too slow nor too fast. Whereas, when we read
something we have read before, or we know about, we usually read very
rapidly. A good reader suits his or her speed to what he or she reads.
Skimming and scanning are additional ways of helping us read more efficiently.
They save time. When we want to get the overall idea or the gist of a text, we
do not need to read every word in it. We can skim or look over the text quickly,
often read the first paragraph, then the first and last sentences of the other
paragraphs quickly. The final paragraph often summarizes the content. This
kind of reading is called skimming. On the other hand, when we want to find
specific information in a text, we scan the text searching for words or phrases
that would give us the information we need. This is called scanning.

He has an artificial brain nearly as complicated as our own. It is an immense
telephone switchboard on an atomic scale, so that billions of possible
“telephone connections” can be compressed into an instrument that will fit
inside a skull.
‘Such brains are manufactured for each model of robot specifically. Each
contains a pre-calculated set of connections so that each robot knows the
English language to start with and enough of anything else that may be
necessary to perform his job.
‘Until now, US Robots has confined its manufacturing activity to industrial
models for use in places where human labour is impractical- in deep mines, for
instance or in underwater work. But we want to invade the city and the home.
To do so, we must get the ordinary man and woman to accept these robots
without fear. You understand that there is nothing to fear’
‘He can’t get angry with you, my dear. | told you that the switchboard
connections of his brain were pre-determined. The most important

On farms and in small towns a hundred and fifty years ago, family members
learned to depend an each other far recreation and fun. There were no radios,
television sets, mavie houses, sparts stadiums, museums, so forth. Parents
and children had to invent their own pleasures. In the evenings after the work
was done, some members of the family read aloud to others. May be they
played games, or sometimes the whole family sang together. Modern families
do few things together as a group. Parents often go out together as a couple,
apart from their children. Each child has his or her friends. Some families have
more than one television set so that all the members do not even watch
television together. Instead of families making their own fun together,
individual members tend to go to recreational facilities for entertainment.

Or, watching things
That eyes can't see-
Too little- or too far-
Or hearing distant
Voice or sound,
No matter where you are.

The radio,
And subs and cars and jets,

And television sets.

But in men’s minds they grew-
The dreams which were
Impossible

Graphs and Charts
How to describe graphs and charts?
Do not copy information from the question paper, use your own words. Make
sure that you describe the mast important information and that your figures
are accurate, Paraphrase the information in the question. Avoid repeating the
same words and phrases and try to vary the sentence structures you use. Give
an overview of the most important trends or patterns.
When describing trends of graphs and charts, it is best to use:
- the simple past to talk about ‘finished’ time, e.g. in 1950, last year.
- the present perfect to talk about ‘unfinished’ time, e.g. since 1950, ever, this
year

- a future tense to talk about future time, e.g. in 2030, next year
We often use the following expression when talking about future or predicted
data, because the simple future is a little too certain:

.. arefis {un)likely

... arefis predicted to

... arefis expected to

For example: Between 1950 and 2030, the proportion of the world's

population is expected to double.
OR we use a verb such as predict and a future tense.
For example: It is predicted that the proportion of the world's population will
double by 2030.

2 To emphasise a difference, you can use: many, much, far, and significantly.

1) What do the numbers on the vertical/horizontal axis measures?

2) How is the information grouped on the other axis?

3) What do the different shades of the bars show?

4) When was the data collected?
The answers will give you the essential information for understanding it.
Make sure you know which units are being used to measure quantities.

car. The second most popular form of transport is the LRT, while buses and
taxis are the main means of transport for the rest of the people.
The table gives more detailed information about why people use their cars.
Surprisingly, 55% of the people need to commute to work by car. Cars are also

The table shows details of participation in a variety of cultural activities over a
year, according to the age of the participants.
Overall, any performance, which includes dancing, singing, playing musical
instruments and acting, had the highest level of participation, with 22% of
respondents participating in the previous 12 months. By contrast, computer
based activities had the lowest level of participation (6 percent).
People aged between 45 and 74 years old were most likely to undertake any
activity to do with crafts (22 percent), while performances were more likely to
be participated in by those aged 16 to 24 (35 percent). The differences
between age groups were particularly marked in the case of visual arts and
writing categories, where participation rates were around three times higher
for younger people than for the older ones. It is clear from the evidence that

Guidelines for question setters and markers for English
1. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
MCQ can be set for testing a number of strategies and skills related to reading such as
scanning, skimming, reading for gist, inferencing (guessing the meaning from the
context) comprehension check etc. Each MCQ item will carry '2 mark. However,
depending on the level of difficulty some items may have 1 mark as well.
In preparing MCQ item, question setters will make sure that learners have to apply
certain skills or strategies of reading in order to be able to choose the right options.
Depending on the level of the learners, items will be set to test learners’ lower order
thinking skills (knowing and understanding) as well as higher order and more critical
thinking (analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating). Use synonyms in the questions to
avoid quoting directly from the original passage. Make the questions a bit round about
so that learners think.
For example :
Text : The Great Wall of China, one of the greatest wonders of the world, was first
built between 220-206 BC.
Question : When was the Great Wall first built? (Don't make this type of question.
Student will just get the answer from the question paper as 'was born’ is common in
both the text in the question paper and the answer.)
Question : What is the initial construction period of the Great Wall? (This question is
Okay as learners has to understand that "was built’ and ‘construction period’ are same.)
Students will write the question number and then write only a/b/c/d that refers to the
correct answer. Whole sentence from the question paper is not required.
The same text can be used for guessing the meaning from the context and Question
Angwer (open ended and close ended). However, the same text cannot be used for
Question-Answer and True/False. Depending on difficulty level and text length,
information transfer and True/False questions can be set from the same text or from
two different texts. Two different texts are preferred to a single text.
Please note the following points while setting MCQ test items :
s Phrase stems as clearly as possible. Confusing questions can generale wrong
answers from students who do understand the material. £2
NN


--- Page 316 ---
Sample Question 311

+ Avoid redundant words and phrases in the stem. Extrancous details make a
question more complex and less reliable.

+ Include any language in the stem that you would have to repeat in each answer
option.

* Options should be similar in length and structure.

* The number of answer options should not be more than four.

+ Distracters must be incorrect, but plausible. Try to include among the
distracters options that contain common errors.

* To make distracters more plausible, use words that is familiar to students.

+ If a recognizable key word appears in the correct answer, it should appear in
some or all of the distracters as well. Don't let a verbal clue decrease the validity
of your exam.

+ Avoid using extreme or vague words in the answers. Use rarely extreme words
like all, always and never or vague words or phrases like usually, typically and
may be in the answers.

+ Avoid using All of the above or None of the above as an answer choice.

In designing MCQs the following guideline has to be followed.
MCQ for grades 9-10
Altogether 7 MCQs will be set. Each MCQ will have 1 mark for a correct answer,
There will be 2 MCQs on vocabulary test (guessing meaning from the context and
inferencing) and 5 MCQs on answering questions (skimming, reading for main ideas
and supporting details, reading to infer meaning). Thus the marks distribution will be:
Vocabulary 1X2 =2
Questions IX5 =5
Total =7
2. True/False
True-false questions are typically used to measure the ability to identify whether
statements of (act are correct. The questions are usually a declarative statement that the
student must judge as true or false.

8

=~


--- Page 317 ---
312 English Grammar and Composition
Follow the general guidelines below while writing True/False items for your students:

* Base the item on a single idea.

+ Write items that test an important idea.

* Avoid lifting statements right from the text.

+ Make the statements as brief as possible.

+ Write clearly true or clearly false statements.

* Try to avoid such words as all, ahways, never. only, nothing. and alone.

+ The use of words like more, less, important, unimportant, large, small, recent,
old, tall, great, and so on, can easily lead to ambiguity.

+ State items positively. Negative statements may be difficult to interpret. This
is especially true of statements using the double negative. If a negative word,
such as "not" or "never," is used. be sure to underline or capitalize it.

+ Beware of detectable answer patterns.

3. Matching

There is no need of a separate reading text for matching. The question itself will have
a context after the texts in part A and part B are properly matched. The numbering of
texts in column A can be i. ii, iii, iv ..... and the texts in column B can be a, b,c, d........
Students only need to match the numbering in the two columns, e.g i, ii, iii, iv ete. (in
column Aj and a, b. c. d etc. (in column B). You can also use 3 columns with texts to
match.

4. Gap filling with or without clues

The text in the gap filling activity is separate and complete. The text for this item will
have a meaningful context too. There will be five gaps in the text. The gaps can be used
for article, preposition, or any other parts of speech without verb as there is separate test
for it. A question setter will choose one particular ilem mentioned earlier to set a
question and use a gap at the particular place. For example, if the question setter wants
10 test the article then there will be a gap at the position of a, an, the or before a noun
that does not take any article. For a question of 3 marks, there will be six gaps in the
text; for 4, there will be 8 gaps; and for 5 marks there will be ten gaps.

Follow the guidelines while writing gap filling (est items:

* Prepare a scoring key that contains all acceptable answers for each item.

o Prefer single word or short phrase answers.

* Beware of open questions thal invite unexpected but reasonable answers.

* Make all the blanks of an equal length.

+ Avoid grammatical clues such as "an.”

5
=


--- Page 318 ---
Sample Question 313
» Place the blanks near the end of the statement. Try to present a complete or
nearly complete statement before calling for a response.
* Limit the number of blanks to one or two per sentence. Statements with too
many blanks waste time as students figure out what is being asked.
e Ifa numerical answer is called for, indicate the units (e.g. currency) in which it
is to be expressed.
5. Cloze test with/without clues
A cloze test is a fill-in-the-blank activity that assesses students’ comprehension of
vocabulary and reading passages or knowledge of grammatical items. In cloze tests
there are recurrent gaps at every 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th word. If the first gap. for example.
is used at the 5th place, all through the text the gap will be at the 5th place. Unlike the
gap filling activity that tests a particular grammar item (c.g. preposition, article,
pronoun, or verb) it is a test for vocabulary (key words) in general. This is why gap
filling activity in the reading section is usually a cloze test. In conlrast, gap filling
activity is a merely a grammar test item.
A cloze test with 5 marks will have ten gaps (.5 for each gap). Considering the level of
difficulty cloze tests without clues at grade 10 can have 5 gaps (1 mark for each gap).
In answering the question, an examinee does not need to reproduce the text in the
answer script. Writing the missing word with the corresponding question number is
enough. However, the whole text with suitable words in the gaps will neither earn any
extra credit or discredit.
6. Information Transfer
Depending on the level of difficulty and length of the text, information transfer and
True/False questions can be set from the same text. However, if the text is too small, do
not use the same text for both the tests as the content will be inadequate for setting
questions. Make sure there is no overlapping or repetitions in the question you have set.
Alternatively you can use two different texts for these two test items.
The marks allocated for information transfer is 1X5 =5 or 0.5X10=5 (depending on the
level of difficulty)
7. Substitution table
It's a grammar test item. It tests whether students can make grammatically correct
sentences [following any particular structures. It's different from matching item. In
matching there might be equal number of texts m each column in a table and students
need to make sentences using a text from each colunm. In designing the test item, the
question setter can write the texts in Column A in a way so that the sequential
Forma-40, English Grammar and Composition, 3-10


--- Page 319 ---
314 English Grammar and Compasition
arrangement of the text makes a context. In a substitution table, depending on marks,
there will be 4 or 5 texts in the left column, 1 or 2 grammar words that shows the form
in the middle column. and extensions at the right column. Each meaningful sentence
made using the texts and the lexical word will have credit.

8. Gap filling with right forms of verbs

Sentences will be written in context in the question paper. Some verbs could be omitted
or given in brackets without any form. IT the verbs are totally omitted in the text, a list
of verbs will be supplied in a box separately. Students’ job will be to use the verb at the
gaps in their correct forms according to the context and other grammatical
considerations. Alternatively base form of verbs can also be supplied in the body of the
text in parenthesis.

Students will write only the right answers with the question number. However, if
anyone uses the text with words at the gaps, it should be accepted as correct answer,

9. Changing sentences

A text will be designed with a certain context. Some of the sentences in the text will
have instructions in the parenthesis on how to change them. Depending on the marks in
the test item, students will be asked to change 5 or 10 sentences. Students will write
only the changed sentence as their answers. They can write the changed sentences in
any order but must use the correct number used for each sentence in the given text.

10. Rearranging

Rearranging measures students’ ability to organize some detached sentences into
a coherent and cohesive text. For SSC, Ss will rearrange eight parts of
story/passage (Sec the sample question for SSC.). Test your test item (with
someone else or you sit for a test) to check whether the sequence of the
answer vary. If the answer varies and each variety has a complete meaning,
redesign the test. Use linking words/sentence connectors to maintain
cohesion and coherence in the text. Learners do not need to reproduce the
text in their answer scripts. If they arrange the corresponding serial of the texts
correctly (such as b. d. a, for v, iii, vi. i ... etc), they will get full credit. Please
remember that the test objective here is the organisation of sentences,
not the copying of texts from the question paper. However if any
learner comes with sentences written in a random text, there is no need to
penalize him/her. Students will get credits for the correct answers. For example, -
if the answer is like this: g


--- Page 320 ---
Sample Question 315
aX bye dXed £ A gX hX Lv j.X the student will get 5
marks.
The test has no relation with the texts used in the previous test items.
11. Writing summary
Use a text not exceeding 300 words for classes 9-10 in the question paper.
Learners will produce a summary using one third words of the given text. For an
example, if the original text has 150 words, learners will produce the summary
in 50 words. However, 5% plus minas is okay. This answer should be written in
random texts not in isolated sentences. There is no question of counting number
of sentences in summary. So do not mention in the question paper own many
lines or sentences learners will use to make a summary. The number of words
used here is important, Make sure that they are writing in their own words, not
copying some sentences from the text. Practice them to avoid examples or
explanations in writing a summary. A fresh text should be given to make
summary. No text used in the previous test items can be used here.
12. Writing a paragraph answering questions
Make sure while answering questions your students will be guided to write a well
structured paragraph. In other words, if the students answer the questions properly,
there will be a paragraph of a befitting topic sentence followed by arguments/ideas to
support the topic sentence and a conclusion to summarise what has been told in the
topic sentence and the body. There cannot be any new ideas in the conclusion.
However, if there are 5 questions to answer, it does not mean that students will write
only five sentences. They will use sentences as per their discretion but the paragraph as
a whole answer the questions. If there are 10 marks for this item, learners should be
able to make at least 10 sentences. The word limit for classes 6-7 is 150 words, for class
8, itis 170 words, and for 9-10 it is 200 words at least. 10% plus minus can be accepted.
Keep an eye on the content rather than the mechanical calculation of sentences. Assess
the paragraph from different aspects such as grammar, ideas, organisation of
ideas, communication, punctuation, and spelling. Do not assess the paragraph from
the perspective of grammar accuracy only. Regarding the composition writing in Paper
2 (which is structurally an essay) the word limit will be 250 for classes 6-7, 300 for
class 8, and 350 for 9-10.

13. Completing a story
There will be the beginning of a story in the question paper. Students will continue the
story and complete it. The answer will vary here. Completing a story when given at
classes 6-8 should be more guided (See sample question for classes 6-7) where
question setter not only begins a story but also provides with some clues for the
extension of ideas. Students will complete the story following the clues. A good idea is
to mention the word limit when there is no clues for the students. Assess the paragraph
from different aspects such as grammar, ideas. communication. organisation etc.: do
not only assess the paragraph only from the perspective of grammar accuracy.
Moreover, use of cohesion (inter-connectedness of the sentences) and coherence
(transition from one idea to another idea) are important here. Word limit here will be
similar to paragraph writing.
14. Open-Ended Questions
Open ended or essay format questions are excellent for measuring higher level
cognitive learning and overall comprehension of a reading text/passage. They allow the
student to select content for their response, to organize their thoughts in a logical
manner and to present their ideas on a given subject matter. Overall, these types of test
questions allow teachers to test student's broader understanding of a reading item.
When writing good open-ended questions, keep the following guidelines in mind:
+ Be sure that the test question clearly states the answer that you are seeking from
the student. For example, "Discuss the outcomes of environment pollution” is a
poor test question. But, worded as "Describe the potential impacts of the
environment pollution on the people of coastal regions in Bangladesh” or, what
are the causes and impacts of environmental pollution on the people of coastal
regions in Bangladesh? is a better test question as it clearly gives the student
something to compare and contrast within a focused area.
+ If you are looking to test comprehension, a good opening line for the test
question is, ‘Explain the following..."
* If you are seeking to test the student's ability to analyze a concept. a good
opening phrase for your test question is, ‘compare and contrast..."
* Don't give students the option to pick 2 or 3 questions from among 5. This can
add confusion for the students and complexity for the teacher when grading for
a classroom. This type of test format often compromises with validity and
reliability of the test.
+ Here you are selling recalling questions, design the question in a way so that
examinees do not have opportunity to pick answers by matching the vocabulary
in the question and answer. 2

Sample Question 317

Question setters have to go by the following guideline in setting questions.

Grade 9-10

There will be 5 open ended questions each bearing 2 marks for the correct answer.

There will be 1 question to recall answer, 3 questions to check students’ understanding,

1 question for analysing information or evaluating something.

A list of action verbs according to Bloom’s Taxonomy for lower order and higher

order thinking questions are supplied here to be used while designing the test

items.

Remembering/recalling: describe, define, list, locate, tell

Understanding: describe, classify, discuss, explain, identify, select, translate, predict

Analysing: solve, use, interpret, skelch, illustrate, classify, differentiate, organise,

relate, identify, categorise, compare, contrast, construct, distinguish, explain,

Evaluating: argue, defend. judge, select. support. value, critique, assess, justify

Creating: construct, develop. investigate, design, imagine, justify

15. Dialogue writing

A dialogue in real situation is an exchange of mformation. This has to be reflected in

the dialogue written by the test giver. A dialogue cannot be a mere combination of

fragmented sentences or snappy phrases or collocations like HiHello/Yes/No/Very

good/Thank you/Welcome/See you/Bye eic. There must be some questions and answers

in full sentences. A dialogue has to contain at least 5 questions and their answers or 10

exchange of statements including some questions in full sentences other than greetings.

16. Writing letters/e-mails

If it is an informal letter, content is important. If it is a formal letter, both content and

form are important. Formal letter can be written either in British style (each paragraph

indented at the beginning for one space, date at the upper right hand corner, name at the

right hand corner at the bottom). It can also be written in American style (All

paragraphs in a line without indenting, date name everything at the left hand corner).
Picture of an envelope or stamp is not needed but address can be written. Yet, if any
5] student provides them - it will not earn any extra credit or penalty.


--- Page 323 ---
318 English Grammar and Composition
Tor e-mails, student must write the e-mail id, subject, and content as written in a
genuine email. Students should be taught in the class that there should be a
considerable margin at the answer script. However, there should not be any penalty for
any examinee if the answer script has no margin. Margin has nothing to do with
assessment of the answer.
‘Word limit should be mentioned in the question paper. Again the word limit is 150
words for classes 6-7, 170 words for class 8, and 200 for classes 9-10 with 10% plus
minus.
17. Describing graphs and charts
Graph should be authentic. Teachers may collect charts from various sources such as
newspapers, magazines, books or from the internet. Alternatively, teachers can use
authentic data and make simple charts by themselves. Describing a graph or chart
needs certain language abilities. The graph and chart presented in the textbook show
that. A marker of answer scripts should keep an eye whether those languages are used
or not. Answers will include the written presentation of data shown in the graph
followed by a concluding remark. A question setter should mention the word limit for
describing the graph or chart. Do not ask students to produce any graph on the answer
sheet. They will only describe it. .
