Preface
The importance of formal education is diversified. The prime goal of modern
education is not to impart knowledge only but to build a prosperous nation by
developing skilled human resources. At the same time, education is the best
means of developing a society free from superstitions and adheres to science
and facts. To stand as a developed nation in the science and technology-driven
world of the 21st century, we need to ensure quality education. A well-planned
education is essential for enabling our new generation to face the challenges of
the age and to motivate them with the strength of patriotism, values, and
ethics. In this context, the government is determined to ensure education as per
the demand of the age.
Education is the backbone of a nation and a curriculum provides the essence of
formal education. Again, the most important tool for implementing a
curriculum is the textbook. The National Curriculum 2012 has been adopted to
achieve the goals of the National Education Policy 2010. In light of this, the
National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) has been persistently
working on developing, printing, and distributing quality textbooks. This
organization also reviews and revises the curriculum, textbook, and assessment
methods according to needs and realities.
Secondary education is a vital stage in our education system. This textbook is
catered to the age, aptitude, and endless inquisitiveness of the students at this
level, as well as to achieve the aims and objectives of the curriculum. It is
believed that the book written and meticulously edited by experienced and
skilled teachers and experts will be conducive to a joyful experience for the
students. It is hoped that the book will play a significant role in promoting
creative and aesthetic spirits among students along with subject knowledge and
skills.
In this era of 21st century, the role of Mathematics is very important in the
development of knowledge and science. Besides, the application of mathematics
has expanded from personal life to family and social life. Keeping all these
things in mind, the Mathematics Textbook has been easily and nicely presented.
Several new mathematical topics have been included to make the Mathematics
useful and enjoyable for grade IX and X students of the secondary level.
It may be mentioned here that due to the changing situation in 2024 and as per
the needs the textbook has been reviewed and revised for the academic year
2025. It is mentionable here that the last version of the textbook developed
according to the curriculum 2012 has been taken as the basis. Meticulous
attention has been paid to the textbook to make it more learner-friendly and
error-free. However, any suggestions for further improvement of this book will
be appreciated.
Finally, I would like to thank all of those who have contributed to the book as
writers, editors, reviewers, illustrators and graphic designers.

Chapter 1
Real Numbers
History of numbers is as old as that of human civilization. Mathematics was
originated from the process of expressing quantity by symbols as numbers.
According to Greek Philosopher Aristotle, formal beginning of mathematics
started with its practice among ancient Egyptian priests. So it can be said that
number based Mathematics was created about two thousand years before the
birth of Jesus Christ. After that numbers and operations on them have reached
today's universal form through the hands of different nations and civilizations.
Indian mathematicians introduced first the concept of O and decimal number
system for satisfying the need of counting natural numbers. This is considered
as a milestone in the representation of numbers. Later on Indian and Chinese
mathematicians expanded the concepts of 0, negative, real, integer and
fractional numbers which the Arabian mathematicians took on the basis with
medieval age. Muslim mathematicians of the Middle East are given the credit
of expressing numbers by decimal fractions. Again they first introduced
irrational numbers in the form of square roots for solution of quadratic
algebraic equations in the 11th century. Historians think that around 500 A.D.
Greek philosophers felt the necessity of irrational numbers, especially square
root of 2, for the purpose of geometrical drawing. In the nineteenth century
European mathematicians gave real numbers complete shape by systematization.
In order to satisfying daily needs students are required to have clear
understanding about real numbers. In this chapter real numbers have been
discussed in detail.
At the end of this chapter students will be able to -

» classify real numbers.

» deduce approximate values of real numbers by expressing it in

decimal fractions.

» classify decimal fraction.

Classification of Real Numbers
Natural Number: 1,2,3,4,... etc are natural numbers or positive whole numbers.
2,3,5,7,.... are primes and 4,6,8,9, ..... etc are composite numbers. If GCD
(Greatest Common Divisor) of two integers is 1 then they are called mutually
primes. For example 6 and 35 are mutually primes.
Integer: All positive and negative fractionless numbers are said to be integers.
For example, ...,—3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,... etc are integers.
Fractional Number: Numbers expressible as P are said to be factional numbers
q
LL 1 3 -5 4
where ¢ # 0, ¢ # 1 and p are not divisible by ¢. For example, 233% ete
are simple fractional numbers. In case of a simple fraction Ed if p < ¢, then the
q
fraction is called proper and if p > ¢ then the fraction is termed improper. For

q
. 3 11 5
are integers and ¢ # 0. For example, i= 3, 5 = 5.5, 3= 1.666, ... etc are
rational numbers. Any rational number can be expressed as ratio of two mutually
prime numbers. All integers and fractions are rational numbers.
Irrational Number: If a number cannot be expressed in the form 2 here Pp
q
and ¢ are integers and ¢ # 0, then it is called an irrational number. Root of a
natural number not equal to perfect square or its fraction is an irrational number. g

Chapter 1. Real Numbers 3
V5 —
For example, v2 = 1.414213 .., 3 = 1.732. , 5 = 1.118... etc are irrational
numbers. No irrational number can be expressed as ratio of two integers.
Decimal Fractional Number: Rational and irrational numbers when expressed
using decimal sign are called decimal fractional number For example,
5 10
3 = 3.0, 3 = 2.5, 3 = 3.3333..., V3 = 1.732... etc are decimal fractional
numbers. If there are finite number of digits after decimal sign, then this is called
finite decimal fraction and if there are infinitely many digits, then it is called
infinite decimal fractions. For example, 0.52, 3.4152 etc are finite decimal
4
fractions, whereas 3= 1.333...,v/5 = 2.123512367...,etc are infinite decimal
fractions. Again, in case of infinite decimal numbers, if some degits after decimal
point are repeated, they are called infinite repeated decimal fractions. If digits
are not repeated, they are called infinite decimal numbers without repeatation.
122 F
For example, 9 = 1.2323, ..,5.1654 etc are infinite repeated decimal fractions
and 0.523050056. ..,2.12340314... etc are infinite decimal numbers without
repeatation.
Real Number: All rational and irrational numbers are called real numbers.
For example, the following numbers are real numbers. a

Positive Number: All real numbers bigger than 0 are called positive numbers.
13 Lo
For example, 2, 59 V2, 0.415, 0.62, 4.120345061 . . ., etc are positive numbers.
Negative Number: All real numbers smaller than 0 are called negative numbers.

Example 1. Find an irrational number between v/3 and 4.
Solution: Here, v/3 = 1.7320508 . ..
Suppose, a and b are two irrational numbers between v/3 and 4.
Where a=v/3 +1 and b=v/3 +2
Obviously a and b are both irrational numbers and both are between v/3 and 4.
That is, v3 <V3+1<v3+2< 4
oa and b are the two desired irrational numbers.
In fact, we can construct countless number of such irrational numbers.
Basic characteristics of addition and multiplication processes of real
numbers :
1. If a and b are real numbers, (i) a + b is a real number and (ii) ab isa real
number.
2. If a and b are real numbers, (i) a +b =0b+ a and (ii) ab = ba
3. Ifa, b, care real numbers, (i) (a+b) +c = a+ (b+c) and (ii) (ab)c = a(bc)
4. If a is real number, there are only two real numbers 0 and 1 such that
(i) 0#1, (ii) a+0=0+a=caand(iii)a-1=1-a=a IS

6. If a,b,c are real numbers, a(b+ ¢) = ab + ac ‘
7. If a,b are real numbers,a <bora=bora>b
8. If a,b,c are real numbers and a < b,then a +c <b+¢
9. If a,b ¢ are real numbers and a < b, then (i) ac < be whenever ¢ > 0

Proposition: V2 is an irrational number.
Proof: Suppose, v/2 is an irrational number.
Then there are two mutually prime numbers p, ¢ > 1 so that v2 = 2 .

Work: Prove that v/3 is an irrational number.
Example 2. Prove that when one is added to the product of 4 consecutive
natural numbers this becomes a perfect square.
Solution: Let the consecutive integers be x, x +1, © +2, +3
If we add 1 to the product of these 4 integers we get:
w(x +1)(z+2)(z +3) +1
=z(z+3)(z+1)(r+2)+1
= (2? +32) (a? + 3x +2) + 1

g =a*+2a+1=(a+1)?=(2>+3z +1)?

which is a perfect square. Therefore, when 1 is added to the product of any four
consecutive natural numbers, this becomes a perfect square.
Decimal Fractions
Each real number can be expressed in decimal fractions. For example,
1 .
2 = 2.0, 5 = 0.4, 3 = 0.333... etc. Decimal fractions are of three types,
namely: finite, repeated and infinite decimal fractions.
Finite decimal fractions: In any finite decimal fraction there is only a finite
numbers of digits after the decimal point. For example, 0.12, 1.023, 7.832, 54.67, ...
ete are finite decimal fractions.
Repeated decimal fractions: In any repeating decimal fraction all or some
digits on the right of decimal point come again and again. For example,
3.333... 2.454545. .., 5.12765765. .. etc are repeated decimal fractions.
Infinite decimal fractions: In an infinite decimal fraction digits on the right
of decimal point never terminate, i.e. the number of digits on the right of the
decimal point will not be finite neither will its part appear repeatedly. For
example, 1.4142135..., 2.8284271... etc are Infinite decimal fractions.
Remarks: Finite and repeating decimal fractions are rational numbers whereas
infinite decimal numbers are irrational numbers. Value of any irrational number
can be determined up to any desired decimal place. If numerator and denominator of
a fraction can be represented by natural numbers, then the fraction is a rational
number.
Work: Classify the following numbers with reasons:
1.723, 5.2333..., 0.0025, 2.1356124 ...,0.01050105... and 0.450123...

Chapter 1. Real Numbers 7
The decimal fraction for which the same digit or a set of digits in order appear
after decimal point is called repeating decimal fraction. The part of the
repeating decimal fraction that appears over and over again is called repeating.
The remaining part is nonrepating.
In a repeating decimal fraction if a single digit repeats, then a point is marked
above that digit. Otherwise point is marked on the first and the last repeating
digits. For example, 2.555... is written as 2.5 and 3.124124124 . .. as 3.124.
In a decimal number if every digit after decimal point is repeating, then it is called
a pure repeating fraction. Otherwise the fraction is called mixed. For example,
1.3 is a pure repeating fraction and 4.235112 is a mixed repeating fraction.
If in the denominator there are digits other than 2, 5 as a factor, then no
numerator will be divisible by that denominator. Since there cannot be any digit
other than 1, 2, ..., 9 at some stage as residue, the same numbers will appear.
Number of digits in the repeating part is always less than the number in the
denominator.

o The repeating decimal fraction has been multiplied with a number equalling
1 followed by as many 0s as many nonrepeating digits are there in the
repeating decimal fraction.

e Subtracting the second number from the first results in a whole number. Tt
may be noted that nonrepeating part has been subtracted from the repeating
decimal fraction by deleting decimal point and repeating point.

e The result of subtraction has been divided by a number equalling as many
9s as many repeating digits were there in the original repeating decimal
fraction, followed by as many Os as there were nonsepeating digits after
decimal point.

e In converting repeating decimal fraction into common fraction we have
denominator having as many 9s as many repeating digits followed by as
many Os as many nonrepeating digits after decimal point. Numerator
equals a whole number we get after removing decimal and repeating points
in the fraction less the number obtained by deleting the decimal point and
all digits in the repeating part.

Remarks: Repeating decimal fractions can always be converted into common
fractions. All repeating decimal fractions are rational numbers.
Example 5. Convert 5.23457 into a common fraction.
Solution: 5.23457 = 523457457457...
5.23457 x 100000 = 523457457457...

Explanation: Since there are 5 digits in the decimal part, the repeating decimal
fraction has been multiplied by 100000 (5 Os after 1). Since there are two decimal
digits before the repeating part (1 followed by 2 0s), repeating decimal fraction
has been multiplied by 100. The second product has been subtracted from the first.
On one side of subtraction is a whole number, and in the other the repeating
decimal number multiplied by (100000 — 1000) = 99900. Both sides are divided

by 99900 to and the common fraction is obtained.
Rules for converting repeating decimal fractions into common
fractions: = the result by sub tracting
Numerator of the desired fraction the integer obtained by deleting the decimal
point of the given decimal fraction and the integer formed by the nonrepeating
portion. Denominator of the desired fraction = numbers formed by putting as many
9s as many digits in the repeating part followed by as many Os in the nonrepeating
part after the decimal point.
These rules have been applied in the following examples to convert a repeating
decimal fractions into common fractions.
Example 6. Convert 45.2346 into common fraction.
5. 452346 — 452 451894 225947 1172

Work: Convert 0.41, 3.04623, 0.012 and 3.3124 into common fractions.
Similar and dissimilar repeating decimal fractions
If for two or more repeating decimal fractions number of digits both in repeating
and nonrepeating parts are the same, then they are called similar repeating decimal
fractions. Otherwise they are called dissimilar repeating decimal fractions. For
example, 12.45 and 6.32; 9.453 and 125.897 are similar repeating decimal fractions.
But, 0.3456 and 7.45789; 6.4357 and 2.89345 are dissimilar repeating decimal
fractions.
Converting dissimilar repeating decimal fractions into similar ones
If we write repeating part of a repeating decimal fraction, the value does not
change. For example, 6.4537 = 6.453737 = 6.45373 = 6.453737. Here cach one of
them is a repeating decimal fraction 6.45373737..., which is an infinite decimal ~~ &

will see that all of them are equal.

In order to convert into similar repeating decimal fractions every repeating decimal
must have equal number of digits in nonrepeating part. Repeating part must
have number of digits equal to lowest common multiple of digits in all repeating
parts.
Example 8. Convert 5.6, 7.345, and 10.78423 into similar repeating decimal
fractions.
Solution: Repeating decimal fractions 5.6, 7.345, and 10.78423 have
nonrepeating digits equalling 0, 1 and 2 respectively. Here 10.78423 has the
most number of digits in nonrepeating part, so in order to convert into similar
repeating decimal fractions we must have 2 digits in nonrepeating part of every
number. 5.6, 7.345 and 10.78423 in repeating decimal fractions have respectively 1,
2 and 3 digits in the repeating part. LCM of 1, 2 and 3 is 6. So in order to
convert into similar repeating decimal fractions we must have 6 digits in the
repating part of every number. So, 5.6 = 5.66666666, 7.345 = 7.34545454 and
10.78423 = 10.78423423. Desired similar repeating decimal fractions are
respectively 5.66666666, 7.34545454 and 10.78423423.
Example 9. Convert 1.7643, 3.24 and 2.78346 into similar repeating decimal
fractions.
Solution: In 1.7643 we have 4 digits in the nonrepeating part and it does not
have repeating part. In 3.24 number of digits in nonrepeating part is 0 and that
of repeating part is 2; in 2.78346 number of digits in nonrepeating part is 2 and
that in repeating part is 3. Here the largest number of nonrepeating digits is 4
and numbers of digits in the repeating parts are 2 and 3, LCM of which is 6. So
each number must have 4 nonrep 2 ating digits and 6 repeating digits.
1.7643 = 1.7643000000, 3.24 = 3.2424242424 2.78346 = 2.7834634634
Desired similar repeating decimal fractions are respectively 1.7643000000,
8 3.2424242424 and 2.78346346341


--- Page 17 ---
12 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Remarks: In order to convert finite decimal fractions into similar decimal
fractions we must add sufficient number of 0s at the end of the number to match
with number of nonrepeating digits. In case of repeating decimal fractions for
each number, numbers of nonrepeating digits have been made equal so should be
the case with repating digits.

Addition and subtraction of repeating decimal fractions

In order to add or subtract repeating decimal fractions, we need to convert
repeating decimal fractions into similar repeating decimals. Then addition or
subtraction must be carried out as in case of finite decimal fractions. If addition
or subtraction of finite and repeating decimal fractions together are done, in
order to make repeating decimal factions similar, the number of digits of
non—repeating part of each repeating fraction should be equal to the number of
digits between the numbers of digits after the decimal points of finite decimal
fractions and that of the non-repeating parts of repeating decimal fraction. The
number of digits of repeating part will be equal to L.C.M. as obtained by
applying the rules and in case of finite decimal fractions, necessary numbers of
zeros are to be used in its repeating parts. Then the same process of addition
and subtraction is to be done following the rules of finite decimal fractions. The
sum or the difference thus obtained will not be the actual one. It should be
observed that in the process of addition of similar decimal fractions if any
number is to be carried over after adding the digits at the extreme left of the
repeating part of the decimal fractions, then that number is added to the sum
obtained and thus the actual sum is found. In case of subtraction the number
to be carried over is to subtract from the difference obtained and thus actual
result is found. The sum or difference thus found is the required sum or
difference.

Remarks:

1. The sum or difference of repeating decimal is also repeating decimal
fractions. In this sum or difference the number of digits in the non-repeating
part will be equal to the number of digits in the non- repeating part of that
repeating decimal fractions, which have the highest number of digits in its
non-repeating part. Similarly, the number of digits in the repeating part of the
sum or the result of subtraction will be the equal to L.C.M. of the numbers of
digits of repeating parts of repeating decimal fractions. If there are finite
decimal fractions, the number of digits in the nonrepeating part of each
repeating decimal fraction will be equal to the highest numbers of digits that
occurs after the decimal point.

2. Converting the repeating decimal fractions into common fractions, addition
and subtraction may be done according to the rules as used in case of fractions
and the sum or difference is converted into decimal fractions. But this method i
of addition or subtraction needs more time. S

Example 10. Add 3.89, 2.178 and 5.89798.
Solution: We have 2 digits in nonrepeating part, and repeating parts have
respectively 2, 2 and 3 for which LCM is 6. At first all these three reepating
decimal fractions have been converted into similar repeating decimal fractions.
3.89 = 3.89898989
2178 =2.17878787
5.80798 = 5.89798793
1197576574 [8 +8+7+2 = 25, here 2 is 2 in hand
+2 here 2 of 25 has been added]
11.97576576
The desired result is 11.97576576 or, 11.97576
Remarks: In the result 576576 is repeating part. But if we assume 576 in the
repeating part, then there will be no change of value.
Note: In order to clarify addition at the rightmost digit we have solved the
addition in a different way:
3.89 = 3.89898989[89
2.178 = 2.17878787|87
5.80798 = 5.80798798|79
11.97576576(55
Here after the end of repe ating part some more digits have been taken. These extra
digits have been separated by a vertical line. Then the addition has been performed.
From the addition of digits just after the vertical line 2 in hands has been added
to the digits just before the vertical line. It may be noted here the digit on the
right side of the vertical line is the same as the first digit of repeatation. Therefore
both the sums ore the same.
Example 11. Add 8.9478, 2.346 and 4.71.
Solution: In order to make repeating decimal fractions similar we must have 3
nonrepeating digits and repeating part must have digits equal to LCM of 2 and
3, that is 6. Now decimal fractions will be added.
8.9478 = 8.947847847
2346 = 2346000000
471 =4m7inng
16.011019564 [8+ 0+ 1+ 1 = 10, Here 1 is 1 in hand
+1 Here 1 of 10 has been added]
16.011019565
The desired sum is 16.011019565

Example 12. Subtract 5.24673 from 8.243.
Solution: Here number of digits in nonrepeating part should be 2 and that in
repeating part should be 6, LCM of 2 and 3. Now the numbers have been converted
into similar numbers, and subtraction has been performed as follows:
8.243 = 8.24343434
5.24673 = 524673673
2.99669761 | subtracting 6 from 3 results in 1 in hand |

2.99669760
The desired result is 2.99669760.
Remarks: If the minuend starting at the repeating dot is smaller than the
subtrahend, we must subtract 1 from the rightmost digit.
Note: In the following is explained why 1 is subtracted from the rightmost
digit in different way.
8.243 =8.2434343434
5.24673 = 5.24673673/67
2.99669760(67
The desired result is 2.99669760|67. We have obtained the same results in both
the cases.
Example 13. Subtract 16.437 from 24.45645.
Solution: LL
24.45645 = 24.45645

hand]

The desired result is 8.01901
Note: In the following is explained why 1 is subtracted from the rightmost
digit in different way.

Multiplication and division of repeating decimal fractions
If repeating decimal fractions are first converted into common fractions and then
multiplication or division operations are performed, we can convert the result
into repeating decimal fractions. If finite decimal fractions and repeating
decimal fractions are multiplied or divided, then this rule should be followed.
However, in case of division if both divisor and dividend are repeating decimal
fractions, then converting them into similar repeating decimal fractions will ease
the operations.

Infinite decimal fractions
There are many decimal numbers that have infinitely many digits after decimal
point. Moreover, a digit or a number of digits do not repeat as well. These are
called infinite decimal fractions. For example, 5.134248513942301 ... is an infinite
decimal fraction. Square root of 2 is an infinite decimal fraction. Let us calculate

In this way the procedure may continue indefinitely. So v2 = 1.4142135.. .is an

Value and approximate values up to certain decimal point
It is not the same to calculate an infinite decimal fraction up to decimal places
or approximate it to certain decimal places. For example, 5.4325893... when
calculated up to 4 decimal places will give 5.4325 whereas its approximate value
up to 4 decimal places will give us 5.4326. However, these two values are same
if we calculate up to 2 decimal places. We can do the same for finite decimal
fractions as well.
Remarks: For finding values up to certain decimal places we must write down
those digits exactly as they are. However, for finding approximation up to certain
decimal places we need to check the next digit. If that digit is 5 or more, 1 should
be added to the last position. Otherwise it will be kept in tact.

Sets and Functions
The term "set” is well known to us. For example, dinner set, set of natural numbers,
set of rational numbers etc. As a modern concept set has versatile use. The
German mathematician George Cantor (1845-1918) first explained the concept of
set. He introduced the notion of infinite set, and created a sensation in mathematical
science. His notion is now known as set theory. In this chapter we shall solve
different problems by using concepts of set, diagrams and logic and idea of a
function will also be introduced.
After completion of this chapter the learners will be able to —

» express the concepts of sets and subsets through symbols.

» describe how sets can be expressed.

» define infinite sets, and distinguish between finite and infinite sets.

» define and verify union and intersection of sets.

» define power sets, and construct power sets of sets with two or three

clements.
» define ordered pairs and cartesian products.
» prove simple set theoretic rules by using examples and Venn
diagrams, and apply these rules for solving different problems.

» define relations and functions, and construct them.

» determine domain and range.

» draw diagrams for functions.
Sets
A set is simply a well organized object of real or imaginary world. For example, i
the set of three text books of Bangla, English and Mathematics. Some other —&


--- Page 28 ---
Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 23
examples are the set of first 10 odd natural numbers, set of integers, set of real
numbers ete. Sets are usually denoted by the capital letters of English alphabet
like A,B,C,... X,Y, Z.
For example, the set of three numbers 2,4, 6 can be denoted by A = {2,4,6}
Each object or member of the set is called its element. For example, if B = {a,b},
to express that a and b are its elements the sign € is used to express the element.
a and b are elements of B;
.a € Band we can read as a, is a member of B (a belongs to B)
b € Bis a member of b, (b belongs to B)
The above set B does not contain ¢. So it is expressed as ¢ ¢ B and is read as ¢
is not a member of B (¢ does not belong to B)
Methods for expressing sets
Sets can be expressed using two methods, namely Roster method or tabular

method and Set Builder Method.
Roster method: In this method all members are listed and put inside {} and
if there are more than one element, then elements are separated by commas. For
example, A = {a,b}, B = {2.4,6}, C' = { Niloy, Shuvro, Tisha } etc.
Set builder method: In this method all elements are not listed rather their
common property is described. For example, A = {x : x is an odd natural number
+. B = {x : x is the first five students of class IX } etc. Here, by ‘:" has been
expressed such that. Since in this method element of the set is specified by rules,
this method is called Rule Method.
Example 1. Express A = {7,14,21, 28} in set building method.
Solution: The elements of A are 7,14, 21,28.
Here, each element is a multiple of 7 and not exceeding 28.
oA ={z: zis a multiple of 7 and 0 < x < 28}
Example 2. Express B = {x : x, is a divisor of 28} by using roster method.
Solution: Here, 28=1x28=2x14=4x7

" .. factors of 28 are 1,2,4,7,14,28

a

BS Hence the desired set is B = {1,2,4,7,14, 28}


--- Page 29 ---
24 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Example 3.Express C' = {x : x positive integer and x? < 18} by using roster
method.
Solution: 1,2,3,4,5,... are positive integers.
Here, if
x =1then 22 =12=1;if x =2then 2° =22=4
If 2 = 3,then 2? =3%=09;if x = 4 then 2° =4%=16
If x = 5, then 7? = 5% = 25 ; which is greater than 18.
.. as per conditions the acceptable positive integers are 1,2,3 and 4.
.-. the given set is C' = {1,2,3,4}
‘Work: Express

1) C={-9,-6,-3,3,6,9} by using set building method.

2) Express B = {y : y integer and y* < 18} by using set building method.
Finite Set
The set number of elements of which can be determined by counting is called
finite set. For example, D = {x,y,z}, EF = {3.6,9,...,60}, FF = {x : = prime
and 30 < x < 70} etc are finite sets. Here, set D contains 3 elements, set E 20
clements and set £9 elements.
Infinite Set
The set elements of which cannot be exhausted by counting is called infinite
set. For example, A = {z : x odd natural number}, set of natural numbers N =
{1.2,3,4,...}, set of integers Z = {...,—3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3...}, set of rational
numbers QQ = {3 ca and b integer and b # 0}. set of rational numbers R etc are
infinite sets.
Example 4. Prove that the set of all natural numbers is an infinite set.
Solution: Suppose the set of natural numbers N is a finite set. Then this set
must have a maximum element K, where KEN. However, according to the
concept of natural numbers, if K is a natural number, then K+1 is also a
natural number which is greater than K. Therefore, K+1 must be an element
of the set of natural numbers N, i.e., K+1€N. s


--- Page 30 ---
Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 25
But initially, we assumed K as the maximum element of the set N.
Subsequently, it turns out that K+1 is also an element of the set N. Similarly,
it can be shown that K+2, K+3, ... are also elements of the set N.
Therefore, the set of natural numbers N cannot be finite. Hence, the set of
natural numbers is an infinite set.
‘Work: Determine which ones are finite and which ones are infinite sets:

1) {3.57

2) {1,2,22,...21%)

3) (BEF)

4) {x : x integer and x < 4}

5) £ :p and ¢ are mutually coprimes and ¢ > 1}

q

6) {y:ye Nandy? < 100 <y’}
Empty Set
If a set does not have any element, the set is said to be empty set, and is denoted
by @. For example, the set of three male students of Girl's school, {x €
N:10 <x < 11}, {z € N : x prime and 23 < x < 29} etc.
Venn-Diagram
John Venn (1834-1923) first expressed sets by using pictures. Here every set is
represented by a geometric figure like rectangles, cicrles and triangles in a plane.
These pictures have been named after John Venn.
Subset
A = {a,b} is a set. Sets {a,b}, {a}, {b} can be formed from the elements of this
set. Again, we can form a subset @ with no elements at all. These sets {a,b}, {a},
{b}, @ are subsets of set A. All the sets that can be formed from a set are called
subsets of the original set. Subset is denoted by C. If B is a subset of A, then we
write B C A. B is a subset of A. Among the subsets above {a,b} is equal to set
A. Each set is the subset of itself. again @ in formed from any set. . @ is a subset
of any set.
Let P= {1,2,3} and Q = {2,3}, R = {1.3}, then P, Q and R are subsets of P.
That is, PC P,Q C P and RC P.

Proper Subset

Of the subsets constructed from a set, the ones that have lesser number of elements
than the original set is called proper set. For example, A = {3,4,5,6} and
B = {3,5} are two sets. Here all elements of B are also clements of A, and
number of elements in Bis less than that of A.

.. Bis a proper subset of A and is expressed as B C A.

In the examples of subsets Q and R are each proper subset of P. It may be
mentioned here that @ is a proper subset of any set.

Example 5. Write down the subsets of P = {x,y,z} and identify those that
are proper subsets.

Solution: Given, P = {x,y,z}

Subsets of P are {z,y, =}, {ey}, (x. 2}. {v. 2}. {ae} {}. {=}. 2.

Proper subsets of P are {x,y}, {z, 2}, {y. 2}, {=}, {y}, {=}, ©

Observation: If number of elements of a set is n, then it has 2" subsets, and
number of proper subsets is 2" — 1.

Equivalent Set

If two sets have the same elements, then they are said to be equivalent sets. For
example, A = {3,5,7} and B = {5,3,3, 7} are two equivalent sets, then they are
denoted by A = B. Note that A= B if and only if AC Band BC A

Again, if A ={3,5,7}, B={5,3,3,7} and C' = {7,7,3,5,5}, then sets A, B and
C are equivalent sets. That is A =B =C

Observation: If order of elements in the set are changed or certain element is
repeated set is not changed.

Difference of Sets

Let A = {1,2,3,4,5} and B = {3,5}. If we delete the elements of set B from
that of A then we get {1,2,4} and is denoted by A\ B or A — B and is read A
delete B.

A-B={1,2345)}— {3,5} ={1,2.4}

Example 6. If P= {x:2 isa factor of 12 } and Q = {x : z is a multiple of 3 5
and xz < 12}, then determine P — Q. =

Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 27
Solution: Given , P = {x : x is a factor of 12 }
Here, factors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12
oP ={1,2.3,4,612}
Again, Q = {x : 3 is a factor of z and = < 12}
Here, multiples of 3 up to 12 are 3,6,9,12
-.Q=1{3,6,9,12}
SL P—Q=1{1,2,34,612} — {3,6,9,12} = {1,2,4}
The required set is: {1,2,4}
Universal Set
All sets under discussion are subsets of a definite set. For example: the set
A = {x,y} is a subset of the set B = {x,y,z} Here, B set is called as universal
set with respect to set A.
So if all sets under discussion are subsets of a given set, then the later set is said
to be universal set with respect to sets under discussion.
Usually universal set is denoted by U. However, other symbols can also be used
to denote universal set. For example, if set of all even natural numbers is C' =
{2,4,6,...} and set of all natural numbers is N = {1,2,3,4,5.6,...}, then N will
be universal set with respect to the set C.
Complement of a Set
Let U be universal set and A be a subset of U
U. Then the set of elements outside of A is
termed as complementary set of A. The Ac
complementary set of A is denoted by A or
A’. Mathematically, A° =U \ A.
Let, P and @ be two sets. Then the elements of P that are not elements of Q
are said to form the complementary set of P with respect to @, and is written
=P\Q
Example 7. If U = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, A = {2,4,6,7} and B = {1,3,5}, then
i. determine A° and B®.

Solution: A°=U\A={1.2,3.4,5.6,7}\ {2,4,6,7} = {1,3,5}

and B* =U \ B={1,2,3,4,5,6,7} \ {1,3,5} = {2,4,6,7}

The required sets are A° = {1,3,5} and B® = {2,4,6,7}

Union of Sets

The set consisting of elements of two or more sets is said to be union of sets.
Let, A and B be two sets. The union of sets A and B is denoted by AU B and
read as A union B. In set building method AUB = {x : 2 € Aor x € B}
Example 8. If C' = {3,4,5} and D = {4,6,8}, determine C'U I)

C D
Solution: Given C'= {3,4,5}
and D = {4,6,8}
CUD ={3,4,5}U{4,6,8} = {3,4,5,6,8}
The set to be determined is: {3,4,5,6,8}

Intersection of Sets.

The set consisting of common elements of two or more sets is known as
intersection set Let A and B be two sets. The intersection of sets A and B is
denoted by A MN B and read as A intersection B. In set building notation
ANB={z:zec Aand x € B}

ANB ANBNC

Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 29
Solution: Given,
P={zeN:2<z<6}={34,506}
Q={reN:xisevenand x <8} ={2,4,6,8}
SL PNQ=1{3.4506}n{24,6,8} = {4.6}
The set to be determined is {4,6} PNQ
Disjoint Set
If there is no element common to any two sets, then these two sets are called
disjoint sets. Let A and B be two sets. If ANB = @ then A and B are said
to be mutually disjoint sets.
Work: If U = {1,3,5,9,7,11}, E = {1,59} and F = {3,7,11}, then
determine EU F¢ and EN F*.

Power Sets
A = {m,n} is a set. Subsets of A are {m,n}, {m},{n}, @, and set of all
sets {{m.n},{m},{n}, @} of Ais called power set of A. Power set of A is
denoted by P(A). So the set formed by all subsets of a set is called power set of
a given set.
Example 10. Find the number of elements of the power sets A = @, B = {a},
C = {a,b}.
Solution: Here P(A) = {&}
.. number of elements of A is 0 and number of elements of its power set is =1 =
20
Again P(B) = {{a}, 2}
number of elements of B is 1, and number of eleemnts of its power set is
=2=2"
and P(C) = {{a}, {0}, {a,b}, @}
~~. number of elements of C' is 2 and number of elements of its power set is = 4 =
92
So, if number of elements of a set is n, then number of elements of its power set is

Ordered Pair

Amena and Sumena of class VIII occupied 1st and 2nd position repectively in

the annual examination. According to merit this can be expressed as (Amena,

Sumena) pair. Similar definite pairs are called ordered pairs.

So, for a pair of elements if the positions are given and expressed, then the pair is

called Ordered Pair.

If the first element of an ordered pair is x, and the second element is y, then the

ordered pair is denoted by (z,y). For the ordered pairs (z,y) and (a,b) will the

equal or (z,y) = (a,b) if and only if x = a and y = b.

Example 11. If (22 + y,3) = (6,2 — y) then, determine (x.y).

Solution: Given,(2r + y,3) = (6,7 —y)

As per conditions of ordered pairs,

ry =06---(1)

T—y=3-(2)

By adding equations (1) and (2) we get 3z =9 or z = 3

Putting value of z in equation (1) we get, 6 +y =6 or y =0

Relations
We know Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh, New Delhi is of India and Bangkok
is of Thailand. There is a relation between capitals and countries. This is country-
capital relation. This relation can be expressed as a set in the following way:
Thailand \ Bangkok
India New Delhi
Banglades] Dhaka
Country Capital
That is country-capital relation = {(Bangladesh, Dhaka ), (India, New Delhi),

(Thailand, Bangkok) }.

If A and B are two sets then, nonnull subset R of ordered pairs of their Cartesian
product A x B is said to be a relation from the set A to the set B. Here set R is N
a subset of the set A x B. That is, RC Ax B g

Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 35
Example 15. Let us assume that A = {3,5} and B = {2,4}
SAX B= (35) x {2.4} = {(3,2),(3,4), (5,2). (5.4)}
SRC {(3,2),(3,4). (5,2), (5,4)}
when for an element x of set A and an element y of set B (x,y) € R, then it is
written Ry and read that x is related to y, that is, x is related to y using relation R.
If © > y, then R = {(3,2), (5.2), (5,4)}
and if z < y then R = {(3,4)}
Again, if there is a relation from set A to set A, that is, R C A x A, then Ris a
relation of A.
If x € A,y € Bis related, then the nonempty subset of ordered pairs (x,y) is called
relation.
Example 16. If P = {2,34}, Q = {4,6} and for elements of P and Q a
relation y = 2x exists, then find the relations.

Let us consider the relation between A and B: f

For the relation y = x 42 |]

if 2 =1,then y = 3
if + = 2, then y =4 |

if x =3,theny =5

A B

That is, there is exactly one value for y for each value of x and x and y are related
by y = x +2. So two variables x and y are related in such a way that for each
value of x there is exactly one value of y. Then y is said to be a function of x.
Usually function of z is denoted by y, f(z), g(x), F(x).

Let y = 2% — 22 + 3 be a function. Here, for each value of = there is exactly one
value of y. Here, both x and y are variables. Although both of them are variables
value of y depends upon the value of x. That is why x is said to be independent
variable and y dependent variable

Example 18. If f(z) = 2? — 4x + 3, then determine f(—1).

Solution: Given, f(z) = 2? — 4x +3
f(D) = (12 —4(-1)+3=1+4+3=8

Example 19. If g(x) = 2% + a2? — 3x —6 then for what value of a will bel g(—2) = 0?
Solution: Given, g(r) = 2* + aa? — 3x — 6
59-2) = (=2)* + a(-2)* = 3(-2) - 6

As per question g(—2) =0

if a = 2,then g(—2) = 0.

Domain and Range

For ordered pairs of any relation the set of first elements is said to be domain
and the set of second elements is said to be range.

Let R be a relation from set A to the set B, that is, R C A x B. For the ordered
pairs of R the set of first elements will be the domain of R and the set of second
elements will be called range of R. The domain of R is denoted by Dom R and

range by Range R. S

Chapter 2. Sets and Functions 37

Example 20. Find domain and range of the relation

S={(2,1),(2,2), (3,2), (4,5)}.

The first elements of the ordered pairs of S are 2,2,3,4 and the second elements

are 1,2,2,5

Dom S ={2,3,4} and Range S = {1,2,5}

Example 21. If A= {0,1,2,3} and R= {(z,y) :x € Aye Aand y = z+ 1},

then express R in tabular method and determine Dom R and Range R.

Solution: Given, R={(z.y):x€ A,ye A y=a+1}

Graph of a Function

Visual display of a function is said to be graph. In order to clarify the concept

of a function significance of graph is important. French philosopher and

mathematician Rene Descartes (1596-1650) was the first to play pioneering role

in introducing relations between algebra and geometry. He introduced a modern

concept in geometry by defining the position of a point in two dimensional space

by drawing two straight lines perpendicularly crossing each other. He termed

the perpendicular lines as axes, and their point of intersection as origin. Let two
9 perpendicularly crossing straight lines XOX’ and YOY” be drawn on a plane.
S Any point lying on this plane can be uniquely determined through these two


--- Page 43 ---
38 Mathematics Classes IX-X
straight lines. Each of these perpendicular straight lines is called axis. The line
XOX’ parallel to horizon is called z-axis, and vertical line YOY” is called
y-axis and point O of intersection of these lines is called Origin.
The signed perpendicular distance of a point, located in the plane determined by
two axes, from the axes are called coordinates of the point. Let P be any point
on the plane determined by two axes. Let us draw perpendiculars PN and PM
from P to XOX’ and YOY’. Then PM = ON which is perpendicular distance to
YOY” from P and PN = OM which is perpendicular distance from P to XOX".
If PM = 2 and PN = y, then coordinates of point P are (x,y).

Here x is called abscissa and y is called ordinate. These coordinates are called
Cartesian coordinates. It is very easy to depict a function using Cartesian
coordinate system. Usually values of independent variable is set along x axis, and
those of dependent variable along y axis.
In order to draw a graph for the function y = f(x), some values of independent
variable are chosen from domain, and with corresponding values of dependent
variables ordered pairs are formed. After that these ordered pairs are placed on
the plane. The resultant points are then connected with line which is known as
graph of the function y = f(x).
Example 22. Draw the graph for the function y = 2x, where —=3 <x <3

A= {z: 2 prime and x <5} = {2,3,5}

co AUB ={2,3,5}U{2,4.6} ={2,3,4,5,6}------ (1)
A\B={2,3,5} — {2,4,6} = {3,5}
B\A=1{2,4,6}—{2,3,5} = {4,6}

Algebraic Expressions
[Prior knowledge of this chapter are attached to the Appendix at the end of this
book. At first the Appendix should be read / discussed. ]
Algebraic formulae are used to solve many algebraic problems. Moreover, many
algebraic expressions are presented by resolving them into factors. That is why the
problem solved by algebraic formulae and the contents of resolving expressions into
factors by making suitable for the students have been presented in this chapter.
Moreover, different types of mathematical problems can be solved by resolving
into factors with the help of algebraic formulae. In the previous class, algebraic
formulae and their related corollaries have been discussed elaborately. In this
chapter, those are reiterated and some of their applications are presented through
examples. Besides, extension of the formulae of square and cube, resolution into
factors using remainder theorem and formation of algebraic formulae and their
applications in solving practical problems have been discussed here in detail.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —
» expand the formulae of square and cube by applying algebraic formulae.
» explain the remainder theorem and resolve into factors by applying the
theorem.
» form algebraic formulae for solving real life problems and solve the problems
by applying the formulae.
Algebraic Expressions
Meaningful organization of operational signs and numerical letter symbols is
called Algebraic Expressions. Such as, 2a + 3b — 4c is an algebraic expression.
In algebraic expression, different types of information are expressed through the
letters a, b, ¢, p, q, r, m, n, x, y, z, ... etc. These alphabet are used to solve
a different types of problems related to algebraic expressions. In arithmetic, only
Q i; . .
S positive numbers are used, where as, in algebra, both positive and negative


--- Page 51 ---
46 Mathematics Classes IX-X
numbers including zero are used. Algebra is the generalization of
arithmetic.
The numbers used in algebraic expressions are constants, their values are
fixed. The letter symbols used in algebraic expressions are variables, their values
are not fixed, they can be of any value.
Algebraic Formulae
Any general rule or resolution expressed by algebraic symbols is called Algebraic
Formula. In class VII and VIII, algebraic formulae and related corollaries have
been discussed. In this chapter, some applications are presented on the basis of
that discussion.
Formula 1. (a+b)? = a® + 2ab + b*
Formula 2. (a —b)? =a — 2ab + b*
Remarks: It is seen from Formula 1 and Formula 2 that, adding 2ab or —2ab to
a® +b, we get a perfect square, i.e. we get (a +b)? or (a — b)?. Substituting —b
instead of b in Formula 1 we get Formula 2 : {a + (=b)}* = a® + 2a(—b) + (=b)?
That is, (a — b)? = a* — 2ab + b*
Corollary 1. a? +b” = (a +b)? — 2ab
Corollary 2. a? +b? = (a — b)? + 2ab
Corollary 3. (a+ b)* = (a —b)? + dab
Proof: (a+b)? = a®+ 2ab+ b> = a® — 2ab + b* + dab = (a — b)* + 4ab [I

Remark: By applying the Corollary 6 product of any two quantities can be
expressed as the difference of two squares.
Formula 3. a? —b* = (a+b)(a—b)
Therefore, the difference of the squares of two expressions = sum of two expressions
x difference of two expressions.
Formula 4. (z+ a)(z +b) = 2% + (a + b)x + ab
Therefore, (r+ a)(z +b) = 22+ (algebraic sum of a and b) = + (the product of a
and b)
Extension of formula for square: There are three terms in the expression
a+ b+ c. It can be considered the sum of two terms (a + b) and c. Therefore, by
applying Formula 1, the square of the expression is,
(a+b+c)*={(a+b) +c}? = (a+b)? +2a+bc+c?
=a? + 2ab +b? + 2ac + 2bc + * = a® + b* + c+ 2ab + 2bc + 2ac

Note: By applying Formula 5, we get,
1) (a+b—c)?={a+b+(—c)}

Factorization
If an expression is equal to the product of two or more expressions, each of the
latter expressions is called a factor of the former expression. After finding the
possible factors of any algebraic expression and then expressing the expression as
the product of these factors are called factorization or resolution into factors.
The algebraic expressions may consist of one or more terms. So, the factors may
also contain one or more terms. Some process of resolving expressions into factors
will be discussed here.
Common Factor: If any polynomial expression has common factor in every
term, at first they are to be found out. For example,
Example 18.  3a%b + Gab? + 12a°b* = 3ab(a + 2b + dab)
Example 19. 2ab(z —y) + 2bc(z — y) + 3ca(z —y) = (x — y)(2ab + 2bc + 3ca)
Perfect Square: An expression can be expressed in the form of a perfect
square.
Example 20. Resolve into factors: dr? +122 +9
Solution: 42? + 122 + 9 = (22)% +2 x 2x x 3 + (3)?
= (22 +3)? = (2x + 3)(2z +3)

Difference of two squares: Expressing an expression as the difference of two
squares and then applying the formula a? — b* = (a + b)(a — b).
Example 22. Resolve into factors: a — 1+ 2b — b?.
Solution: a —1+2b—b? =a” — (b* — 20+ 1)

= (a? + 8b%)? — (dab)?

= (a + 8b” + dab) (a® + 8b* — 4ab)

= (a® + dab + 8b*)(a® — dab + 8b?)

Work: Resolve into factors:

Middle term factorization: Factors can be determined by applying the
formula 2? + (a + b)x + ab = (x + a)(x + b). In this method, a polynomial of the
form 2° + pa + ¢ can be factorized, if two integers a and b can be found so that,
a+b =pand ab = q. For this, two factors of ¢ with their signs are to be taken
whose algebraic sum is p. If ¢>0 , a and b will be of same sign and if ¢< 0 , a and
b will be of opposite sign. To be noted p and ¢ may not be integers.
Example 24. Resolve into factors: z* + 12x + 35
Solution: #2 +122 +35 =a? + (5+ Nx +5 x T= (z+ 5) (xz +7)
Example 25. Resolve into factors: z% +z — 20
Solution: 22 +x — 20 = 2% + (5 — 4) + (5)(—4) = (z + 5)(z — 4) g

Middle Term Break-Up: By middle term break-up method of polynomial of
the form of az? + bx +c would be az? + br +c = (rz +p) (sz +q) if az’ + br +c =
rsa? + (rq + sp)x + pg. That is, a = rs, b = rq + sp and ¢ = pg. Hence,
ac = rspq = (rq)(sp) and b = rq + sp. Therefore, to determine factors of the
polynomial ax? + bx + ¢, ac, that is, the product of the coefficient of 2? and the
term free from z are to be expressed into two such factors whose algebraic sum is
equal to b, the coefficient of x.

Perfect Cube Form: Factors can be determined by expressing an expression
in the form of perfect cube.
Example 27. Resolve into factors: 8z° + 36x%y + 54ay? + 274°
Solution: 8z% + 3622y + Sdwy?® + 27y°

Formulae of addition or subtraction of two cubes: Factors can be

a® — b= (a—b)(a® + ab +b?)

Remainder Theorem
In the following example, if 62% — 72 +5 is divided by x — 1,then what is quotient
and remainder?
z—1) 62° —Tx +5 (6r—1
62? —6x
—r +5
—z +1
4
Here, x — 1 is divisor, 62% — 7x + 5 is dividen,6x — 1 is quotient and 4 is
remainder.
We know, dividend = divisor x quotient + remainder
Now, if we indicate the dividend by f(x), the quotient by h(x), the remainder by
r and the divisor by (x — a), from the above formula, we get,
f(z) = (xz —a)- h(x) +r, this formula is true to all values of a.
Substituting = = a in both sides we get,
fla)=(a—a) h(a) +r =0-h(a)+r=r
Hence, r = f(a)
Therefore, if f(z) is divided by (z — a), the remainder is f(a). This formula is
known as remainder theorem. That is, the remainder theorem gives the remainder
when a polynomial f(z) of positive degree is divided by (x —a) without performing
actual division. In the above example if a = 1, then f(x) = 62% — 7x + 5.
oo f(1) = 6—=T7+5 = 4 which is equal to the remainder. The degree of the divisor
polynomial (z—a) is 1, If the divisor is a factor of the dividend, the remainder will
be zero and if it is not zero, the remainder will be a number other than zero.
Corollary 11. (x — a) will be a factor of f(z) if and only if f(a) = 0.
Proof: Let, f(a) = 0. Therefore, according to remainder theorem, if f(x) is
divided by (x — a), the remainder will be zero. Hence, (x — a) will be a factor of
f(x).
Conversely, let, (x — a) is a factor of f(z).
Therefore, f(x) = (x — a) - h(x), where h(x) is a polynomial. 5
Putting x = a in both sides we get, S

fla) =(a—a) h(a) =0
co fla)=0
Hence, any polynomial f(z) will be divisible by (x — a) if and only if f(a) = 0.
This formula is known as factor theorem.
Proposition 12. If degree of f(z) is positive and a # 0, then if f(z) is divided
by (ax +b), the remainder will be f (-2).
Proof: Degree of divisor ax +b, (a #0) is 1.
Hence, we can write: f(z) = (az +b) h(z) +r =a (x + B) ch(z) +r
b
sfx) = (a+ . ca h(z) +r
It is clear that, if f(x) is divided by (x + 2). the quotient will be a - h(x) and
the remainder will be 7.
Here, divisor = 2 — (+9)

Hence, according to remainder theorem r = f 4

Therefore, if f(x) is divided by (az + b), the remainder will be { —— |) .

Now, putting = = 1, —1 we see that the value of f(z) is not zero.
But, putting = = 2 we see that the value of f(z) is not zero.

Forming and applying algebraic formulae in
solving real life problems
In our daily business we face the realistic problems in different time and in
different ways. These problems are described linguistically. In this section, we
shall discuss the formation of algebraic formulae and their applications in solving
different problems of real surroundings which are described linguistically. As a
result of this discussion the students on the one hand, will get the conception
about the application of mathematics in real surroundings, on the other hand,
they will be eager to learn mathematics for their understanding of the
involvement of mathematics with their surroundings.
Methods of solving the problems:
1. At first the problem will have to be observed carefully and to read attentively
and then to identify which are unknown and which are to be determined. -

Example 34. For a function of Annual Sports, members of an association
made a budget of Tk. 45000 and decided that every member would subscribe
equally. But 5 members refused to subscribe. As a result, amount of subscription
of each member increased by Tk. 15 per head. How many members were in the
association?
Solution: Let the number of members of the association be 2 and amount of
subscription per head be Tk. ¢.
Then total amount of subscription, Tk A = gx = 45,000 .
Actually numbers of members were (z — 5) and amount of subscription per head
became Tk. (gq + 15) .
Then, total amount of subscription (x — 5)(g + 15)
By the question,

qr = (zr =5)(¢ +15) + (1)

qr = 45000 +++ (2)
From equation (1) we get,

gz = (¢ — 5)(q + 15)

or, gv = qr — 5g + 152 — 75

or, 5¢ = 15x — 75 = 5(3x — 15)
Cog =3r—15
Putting the value of ¢ in (2), we get,

(3x — 15) x x = 45000

or, 32% — 152 = 45000

or, #2 — 52 = 15000 [dividing both sides by 3]

or, 22 — 5x — 15000 = 0

or, x2 — 125 + 120x — 15000 = 0

or, x(x — 125) + 120(x — 125) = 0

or, (x —125)(z + 120) = 0

,. Therefore, (x — 125) = 0 or (x +120) = 0
B or, x = 125 or, x = —120


--- Page 75 ---

Since the number of members cannot be negative, hence the value of = as —120
is not acceptable.
Therefore, number of members of the association is 125

Example 36. A boatman can row z= km in time ¢; hour against the current.
To cover that distance along the current he takes t, hour. How much is the speed
of the boat and the current?
Solution: Let the speed of the boat in still water be « km per hour and that of
the current be v km per hour.
Then, along the current, the effective speed of boat is (u + v) km per hour and
against the current, the effective speed of boat is (u — v) km per hour.
We know, speed = distance traversed

flows out 14 litre of water per minute. If the two pipes are opened together and
the empty tank is filled up in 96 minutes, how much water does the tank contain 7.
Solution: Let x litre of water flows in per minute by the first pipe and the tank
can contain y litre of water.
According to the question, the tank is filled up by first pipe in 12 minutes
sy=12z (1)
Again, the empty tank is filled up by the two pipes together in 96 minutes.
oy =962— 96x14 ++ (2)

Exponents and Logarithms
Very large or very small numbers or expressions can easily be expressed by using
exponents. As a result, calculations and solution of mathematical problems
become easier. Scientific or standard form of a number is expressed by using
exponents. Therefore, every student should have the knowledge of exponents
and its applications.
Exponents be get logarithms. Multiplication and division of numbers or expressions
and exponent related calculations have become easier with the help of logarithms.
Use of logarithm in scientific calculations was the only way before calculators and
computers became available. Still the use of logarithm is important as the alternative
of calculator and computer.
In this chapter, exponents and logarithms have been discussed in detail.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —

» explain the rational exponent.

» explain and apply the positive integral exponents, zero and negative integral

exponents.
» solve problems by describing and applying the rules of exponents.
» explain the n th root and rational fractional exponents and express the n th
root in terms of exponents.

» explain logarithms.

» prove and apply the formulae of logarithms.

» explain natural logarithm and common logarithm.

» explain the scientific form of numbers.

» explain the characteristic and mantissa of common logarithm.

Logarithms
Logarithms are used to find the values of exponential expressions. Logarithm
is written in brief as Log. Product, quotient, etc. of large numbers or quantities
can easily be determined with the help of log.
We know, 2° = 8; this mathematical statement is written in terms of log as
log,8 = 3. Again, conversely, if log,8 = 3, it can be written in terms of exponents
as 2° = 8. That is, if 2° = 8, then log,8 = 3 and conversely, if log,8 = 3, then
; 1 1 1
2% = 8. Similarly, 27% = ¥=3 can be written in terms of log as, logy3 ==3.
If a® = N,(a > 0, a # 1), then z = log, N is defined as a based log, N
Note: If a > 0,then a” is always positive whatever may be the values of x,
positive or negative. So, only the log of positive numbers has values that are real;
log of zero or negative numbers have no real value.

Scientific or Standard Form of Numbers
We can express very large numbers or very small numbers easily by using exponents.
Such as, the velocity of light = 300000 km/sec = 300000000 m/sec

= 3 x 100000000 m/sec = 3 x 10% m/sec
Again, the radius of a hydrogen atom

= 0.0000000037 cm

3
= EE em = 37 x 107 cm
10000000000

=3.7x10 x 107" cm = 3.7 x 107 em
For convenience, very large or very small numbers are expressed in the form a x10"
where, 1 < a < 10 and n € Z. The number of the form a x 10" is called the
scientific or standard form of number.

Work: Express the following numbers in scientific form :

1) 15000 2) 0.000512 3) 123.000512
Logarithmic Methods
Logarithmic systems are of two kinds :

1) Natural Logarithm: Mathematician John Napier (1550-1617) of
Scotland published the first book on logarithms in 1614 by taking e as its
base. e is an irrational number, e = 2.71828... Such logarithms are called
Napierian logarithm or e¢ based logarithm or
natural logarithm. log, x is also written in the form Inz.

2) Common Logarithm: Mathematician Henry Briggs (1561-1630) of
England prepared a table of logarithm (log table) in 1624 with 10 as
the base. This logarithm is called Briggs logarithm or 10 based
logarithm or practical logarithm. This logarithm is written as log,,z.

Note: If there is no mention of base, in case of algebraic expressions e and in
case of numbers 10, are considered the base. In log table 10 is taken as the base.

Characteristics of Common Log
Let a number N be expressed in the scientific form as
N =a x10", where N > 0,1 <a<10and ne Z
Taking base 10 log of both sides we get.
log, N = log,o(a x 10") = log,a + log;,10™ = log, ya + nlog,,10
ology oN =n + logyga [1.7 logy10 = 1]
Suppressing the base 10, we have, logN = n + loga
n is called the characteristic of log/V.
Note: It is evident from the table that characteristic of a number having m
digits to the left of decimal point is 1 less than the number of digits to the left of
decimal sign and that will be positive. That is if the mentioned number of digits
is m, the characteristic of logarithm will be m-1.

Note: Now observe from the following table: If there is no integral part of
a number and the number has k& 0's immediately after decimal point, then the
characteristic of the logarithm of the number is {—(k + 1)}.
If any characteristic is negative, ‘—’ sign is not placed on the left of the
characteristic, rather ‘—" (bar sign) over the characteristic. Such as,
characteristic —3 will be written as 3. Otherwise, whole part of the log including
mantissa will be negative.

Mantissa of Common Log
Mantissa of Common Logarithm of any number is a non-negative number less than
1. It is mainly an irrational number. But the value of mantissa is determined upto
a certain decimal place. Mantissa of the log of a number can be found from the
log table. Again, it can also be found by calculator. We shall find the mantissa
of the log of any number by using 2nd method, that is by calculator.

Equations in One Variable
‘We have known in the previous class what equation is and learnt its usage. We
have also learnt the solution of simple equations with one variable and acquired
knowledge thoroughly about the solution of simple equations by forming
equations from real life problems. In this chapter, linear and quadratic equations
and identities have been discussed and their usages have been shown to solve the
real life problems.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —

» explain the conception of variable.

» explain the difference between equation and identity.

» solve the linear equations.

» solve by forming linear equations based on real life problems.

» solve the quadratic equations and find the solution sets.

» form the quadratic equations based on real life problems and solve.

Variable

We know, = + 3 = 5 is an equation. To solve it, we find the value of the unknown
quantity xz. Here the unknown quantity x is a variable. Again, to solve the
equation z + a = 5, we find the value of z, not the value of a. Here, z is assumed
as variable and a as constant. In this case, we shall get the values of z in terms
of a. But if we determine the value of a, we shall write a = 5 — z; that is, the
value of a will be obtained in terms of x. Here a is considered a variable and x a
constant. But if no direction is given, conventionally x is considered a variable.
Generally, the small letter x,y, z, the ending part of English alphabet are taken as
variables and a, b, ¢, the starting part of the alphabet are taken as constants.
The equation, which contains only one variable, is called a linear equation with Nn
one variable. Such as, v +3 =5, 2? — 5x + b= 0, 2y* + 5y — 3 = 0 etc. g

Chapter 5. Equations in One Variable 99
Ifaset, S={r:2€ R11 <x <10}, z-may be any real number from 1 to 10.
Here, a is a variable. So, we can say that when a letter symbol means the element
of a set, it is called variable.
Degree of an equation : The highest degree of a variable in any equation
is called the degree of the equation. Degree of each of the equations = + 1 =
5, 2e—1=ua+5, y+7=2y—3is 1; these are linear equations with one variable.
Again, the degree of each of the equations 2% + 52 +6 = 0, y? —y = 12, 4a” —
2x = 3 — 6x is 2; these are linear equations with two variable. The equation
22% — 2% — dz +4 = 0 is the equation of degree 3 with one variable.
Equation and Identity

Equation: There are two polynomials on two sides of the equal sign of an
equation, or there may be zero on one side (mainly on right hand side). Degree
of the variable of the polynomials on two sides may not be equal. Solving an
equation, we get the number of values of the variable equal to the highest degree
of that variable. This value or these values are called the roots of the equation.
The equation will be satisfied by the root or roots. In the case of more than
one root, these may be equal or unequal. Such as, roots of 2? — 5z + 6 = 0 are
2,3. Again, though the value of z in equation (x — 3)* = 0 is 3, the roots of the
equations are 3,3.
Identity: There are two polynomials of same (equal) degree on two sides of equal
sign. Identity will be satisfied by more values than the number of highest degree
of the variable. There is no difference between the two sides of equal sign; that is
why, it is called identity. Such as, (z+ 1)? — (x — 1)? = 4x is an identity; it will be
satisfied for all values of z. So this equation is an identity. Each algebraic formula
is an identity. Such as, (a +b)? = a*+2ab+b?, (a—b)? =a? —2ab+1V?, a* —b* =
(a+b)(a—b), (a+b)*=a®+ 3a®b + 3ab® + b° etc. are identities.
All equations are not identities, In identity = sign is used instead of equal (=) sign. But
as all identities are equations, in the case of identity also, generally the equal sign
is used.
Distinctions between equation and identity are given below :

Solving Linear Equations
In case of solving equations, some rules are to be applied. If the rules are known,
solution of equations becomes easier. The rules are as follows:
1. If the same number or quantity is added to both sides of an equation, two
sides remain equal.
2. If the same number or quantity is subtracted from both sides of an equation,
two sides remain equal.
3. If both sides of an equation are multiplied by the same number or quantity,
the two sides remain equal.
4. If both sides of an equation are divided by same non- zero number or io
quantity, the two sides remain equal. S

Chapter 5. Equations in One Variable 101
The rules stated above may be expressed in terms of algebraic expressions as
follows:
If zr =aand c #0,
(i)z+c=a+c (i) zr —c=a—c (iii) xc = ac (in) 2 =2
Besides, if a,b and ¢ are three quantities, if a =b+4¢, a —b=cand ifa+c=0b,
a=b—c
This law is known as transposition law and different equations can be solved by
applying this law. If the terms of an equation are in fractional form and if the
degree of the variables in each numerator is 1 and the denominator in each term
is constant, such equations are linear equations.

Now, we shall solve such equations which are in quadratic form. These equations

Usage of linear equations

In real life we have to solve different types of problems. In most cases of solving

these problems mathematical knowledge, skill and logic are necessary. In real

cases, in the application of mathematical knowledge and skill, as on one side the

problems are solved smoothly, on the other side in daily life, solutions of the

problems are obtained by mathematics. As a result, the students are interested in

mathematics. Here different types of problems based on real life will be expressed

by equations and they will be solved.

For determining the unknown quantity in solving the problems based on real life,

variable is assumed instead of the unknown quantity and then equation is formed

by the given conditions. Then by solving the equation, value of the variable,

that is the unknown quantity is found.

Example 5. The digit of the units place of a number consisting of two digits is

2 more than the digit of its tens place. If the places of the digits are interchanged,

the number thus formed will be less by 6 than twice the given number. Find the

number.

Solution: Let the digit of tens place be z.Then the digit of units place will be

T +2.

.. the number is 10x + (x + 2) or, 11x +2

Now, if the places of the digits are interchanged, the changed number will be

10(z +2) + x or, 11x + 20

By the question, 112 + 20 = 2(11z +2) — 6

or, Ile +20 = 22x +4 — 6

or, 22x — 11x = 20 4 6 — 4 [by transposition]

or, 11x = 22

or, x =2

the number is 112 +2 =11x2+2=24

.. given number is 24

Example 6. In a class if 4 students are seated in each bench, 3 benches remain
pS vacant. But if 3 students are seated on each bench, 6 students are to remain
5 standing. What is the number of students in that class ?


--- Page 109 ---
104 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Solution: Let the number of students in the class be x
Since, if 4 students are seated in a bench, 3 benches remain vacant, the number
of benches of that class = hn +3
Again, since, if 3 students are seated in each bench, 6 students are to remain
. r—6
standing, the number of benches of that class = 5
Since the number of benches is fixed,
x r—6 r+12 2-6
therefore, — = a Me
herefore, 1 +3 3 or, 7 3
or, dr — 24 = 3x +36 or, dr — 3x = 36 + 24
or, x = 60
number of students of the class is 60
Example 7. Mr. Kabir, from his Tk. 56000, invested some money at the rate
of profit 12% per annum and the rest of the money at the rate of profit 10% per
annum. After one year he got the total profit of Tk. 6400. How much money did
he invest at the rate of profit 12%?
Solution: Let Mr. Kabir invest Tk. x at the rate of profit 12%.
.-. he invested Tk. (56000 — x) at the rate of profit 10%.

or, 2x = 640000 — 560000
or, 2x = 80000
or, x = 40000

Quadratic Equations in One Variable

Equations of the form az? + bx + ¢ = 0 [where, a,b,c are constants and a # 0)

are called the quadratic equation in one variable. Left hand side of a quadratic

equation is a polynomial of second degree, right hand side is generally taken to
be zero.

In class VIII, we have factorized the quadratic expressions inone variable of

the forms 2% + pa + ¢ and ax? + bx + c. Here, we shall solve the equations of the

forms 2° + pz + ¢ = 0 and az? + bx + ¢ = 0 by factorizing the left hand side and

by finding the value of the variable.

An important law of real numbers is applied to the method of factorization. The

law is as follows :

If the product of two quantities is equal to zero, either only one of the quantities

or both quantities will be zero. That is, if the product of two quantities a and b

ie,ab=0,a=0o0r,b=0, or, both a=0and b=0.

[Prior knowledge of this chapter are attached to the Appendix at the end of this
book. At first the Appendix should be read / discussed. ]
Geometry is an old branch of mathematics. The word ‘geometry’ comes from the
Greek words ‘geo’, meaning the ‘earth’, and ‘metrein’, meaning ‘to measure’. So,
the word ‘geometry’ means ‘the measurement of land.’ Geometry appears to
have originated from the need for measuring land in the age of agricultural
based civilization. However, now a days geometry is not only used for measuring
lands, rather knowledge of geometry is now indispensable for solving many
complicated mathematical problems. The practice of geometry is evident in
relics of ancient civilization. According to the historians, concepts and ideas of
geometry were applied to the survey of lands about four thousand years ago in
ancient Egypt. Signs of application of geometry are visible in different practical
works of ancient Egypt, Babylon, India, China and the Incas civilisation. In the
Indian subcontinent there were extensive usages of geometry in the Indus Valley
civilisation. The excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro show the evidence
of that there was a well planned city. For example, the roads were parallel to
each other and there was a developed underground drainage system. Besides the
shape of houses shows that the town dwellers were skilled in mensuration. In
Vedic period in the construction of altars (or vedis) definite geometrical shapes
and areas were maintained. Usually these were constituted with triangles,
quadrilaterals and trapeziums.
But geometry as a systematic discipline evolved in the age of Greek civilization.
A Greek mathematician, Thales is credited with the first geometrical proof. He
proved logically that a circle is bisected by its diameter. Thales’ pupil Pythagoras
developed the theory of geometry to a great extent. About 300 BC Euclid, a
Greek scholar, collected all the work and placed them in an orderly manner in
his famous treatise, ‘Elements’. ‘Elements’ completed in thirteen chapters is the
foundation of modern geometry for generations to come. In this chapter, we shall
discuss logical geometry in accordance with Euclid. N

At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to -
» describe the basic postulates of plane geometry.
» prove the theorems related to triangles.
» apply the theorems and corollaries related to triangles to solve problems.
Concepts of space, plane, line and point
The space around us is limitless. It is occupied by different solids, small and large.
By solids we mean the grains of sand, pin, pencil, paper, book, chair, table, brick,
rock, house, mountain, the earth, planets and stars. The concept of geometry
springs from the study of space occupied by solids and the shape, size, location
and properties of the space.
A solid occupies space which is spread in three directions. This spread in three
directions denotes the three dimensions (length, breadth and height) of the solid.
Hence every solid is three dimensional. For example, a brick or a box has three
dimensions (length, breadth and height). A sphere also has three dimensions.
Although the dimensions are not distinctly visible, it can be divided distinctly
into length-breadth-height.
NL (ay
The boundary of a solid denotes a surface, that is, every solid is bounded by one
or more surfaces. For example, the six faces of a box represent six surfaces. The
upper face of a sphere is also a surface. But the surfaces of a box and of a sphere
are different. The first one is plane while the second one is curved.
Two-dimensional surface: A surface is two dimensional; it has only length and
breadth and is said to have no thickness. Keeping the two dimension of a box
unchanged, if the third dimension is gradually reduced to zero, we are left with a
face or boundary of the box. In this way, we can get the idea of surface from a
solid.

‘When two surfaces intersect, a line is formed. For example, two faces of a box
meet at one side in a line. This line is a straight line. Again, if a lemon is cut by
a knife, a curved line is formed on the plane of intersection of curved surface of
the lemon.
Line: A line is one-dimensional; it has only length and no breadth or thickness.
If the width of a face of the box is gradually receded to zero, we are left with only
line of the boundary. In this way, we can get the idea of line from the idea of
surface.
SS  —

The intersection of two lines produces a point. That is, the place of intersection
of two lines is denoted by a point. For example, the two edges of a box meet at a
point. A point has no length, breadth and thickness. If the length of a line is gradually
reduced to zero, at last it ends in a point. Thus, a point is considered an entity of
zero dimension.
Euclid’s Axioms and Postulates
The discussion above about surface, line and point do not lead to any definition —
they are merely description. This description refers to height, breadth and length,
neither of which has been defined. We only can represent them intuitively. The
definitions of point, line and surface which Euclid mentioned in the beginning of
the first volume of his ‘Elements’ are incomplete from modern point of view. A
few of Euclid’s axioms are given below:

1. A point is that which has no part.

2. A line has no end point.

3. A line has only length, but no breath and height

4. A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.

5. A surface is that which has length and breadth only.

6. The edges of a surface are lines.

7. A plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself.
It is observed that in this description, part, length, width, evenly etc have been =
accepted without any definition. It is assumed that we have primary ideas about —&


--- Page 126 ---
Chapter 6. Lines, Angles and Triangles 121
them. The ideas of point, straight line and plane surface have been imparted on
this assumption. As a matter of fact, in any mathematical discussion one or more
elementary ideas have to be taken granted. Euclid called them axioms. Some of
the axioms given by Euclid are:

1. Things which are equal to the same thing, are equal to one another.

2. If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.

3. If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.

4. Things which coincide with one another, are equal to one another.

5. The whole is greater than the part.
In modern geometry, we take a point, a line and a plane as undefined terms and
some of their properties are also admitted to be true. These admitted properties
are called geometric postulates. These postulates are chosen in such a way that
they are consistent with real conception. The five postulates of Euclid are:
Postulate 1: A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other
point.
Postulate 2: A terminated line can be produced indefinitely.
Postulate 3: A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius.
Postulate 4: All right angles are equal to one another.
Postulate 5: If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior
angles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the
two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the sum of
angles is less than two right angles.
After Euclid stated his postulates and axioms, he used them to prove other results.
Then using these results, he proved some more results by applying deductive
reasoning. The statements that were proved are called propositions or theorems.
Euclid is his ‘elements’ proved a total of 465 propositions in a logical chain. This
is the foundation of modern geometry.
Note that there are some incompleteness in Euclid’s first postulate. The drawing
of a unique straight line passing through two distinct points has been ignored.
Postulate 5 is far more complex than any other postulate. On the other hand,
Postulates 1 through 4 are so simple and obvious that these are taken as ‘self-
evident truths’. However, it is not possible to prove them. So, these statements
Forma-16, Mathematics, Class 9-10


--- Page 127 ---
122 Mathematics Classes IX-X
are accepted without any proof. Since the fifth postulate is related to parallel
lines, it will be discussed later.
Plane Geometry
It has been mentioned earlier that point, straight line and plane are three
fundamental concepts of geometry. Although it is not possible to define them
properly, based on our real life experience we have ideas about them. As a
concrete geometrical conception space is regarded as a set of points and straight
lines and planes are considered the subsets of this universal set. That is,
Postulate 1: Space is a set of all points and plane and straight lines are the
sub-sets of this set.
From this postulate we observe that each of plane and straight line is a set and
points are its elements. However, in geometrical description the notation of sets
is usually avoided. For example, a point included in a straight line or plane is
expressed by © the point lies on the straight line or plane’ or ‘the straight line
or plane passes through the point’. Similarly if a straight line is the subset of a
plane, it is expressed by such sentences as ‘the straight line lies on the plane, or
the plane passes through the straight line’.
It is accepted as properties of straight line and plane that,
Postulate 2: For two different points there exists one and only one straight line,
on which both the points lie.
Postulate 3: For three points which are not colinear, there exists one and only
one plane, on which all the three points lie.
Postulate 4: A straight line passing through two different points on a plane lie
completely in the plane.
Postulate 5:
1) Space contains more than one plane.
2) In each plane more than one straight lines lie.
3) The points on a straight line and the real numbers can be related in such a
way that every point on the line corresponds to a unique real number and
conversely every real number corresponds to a unique point of the line. Nn

Remarks: The postulates from 1 to 5 are called incidence postulates.
The concept of distance is also an elementary concept. It is assumed that,
Postulate 6:
1) Each pair of points P and @ determines a unique real number which is
known as the distance between point P and @ and is denoted by PQ.
2) If P and @ are different points, the number PQ is positive. Otherwise,
PQ =0.
3) The distance between P and ) and that between @ and P are the same,
ie. PQ =QP.
Since PQ = QP, this distance is called the distance between point P and point
Q. In practical, this distance is measured by previously determined unit.
According to postulate 5(c) one to one correspondence can be established
between the set of points in every straight line and the set of real numbers. In
this connection, it is admitted that,
Postulate 7: One-to-one correspondence can be established between the set of
points in a straight line and the set of real numbers such that, for any points P,Q,
PQ = |a — b| where, the one-to-one correspondence associates points P and Q
to real numbers a and b respectively.
If the correspondence stated in this postulate is made, the line is said to have been
reduced to a number line. If P corresponds to a in the number line, P is called
the graph point of P and a the coordinates of P. To convert a straight line into
a number line the co-ordinates of two points are taken as 0 and 1 respectively.
Thus a unit distance and the positive direction are fixed in the straight line. For
this, it is also admitted that,
Postulate 8: Any straight line AB can be converted into a number line such
that the coordinate of A is 0 and that of B is positive.
Remarks: Postulate 6 is known as distance postulate and Postulate 7 as ruler
postulate and Postulate 8 as ruler placement postulate.
Geometrical figures are drawn to make geometrical description clear. The model
of a point is drawn by a thin dot by tip of a pencil or pen on a paper. The model of
a straight line is constructed by drawing a line along a ruler. The arrows at ends
of a line indicate that the line is extended both ways indefinitely. By postulate 2,
S two different points A and B define a unique straight line on which the two points


--- Page 129 ---
124 Mathematics Classes IX-X
lie. This line is called AB or BA line. By postulate 5(c) every such straight line
contains infinite number of points.
According to postulate 5(a) more than one plane
exist. There is infinite number of straight lines in
every such plane. The branch of geometry that ~
deals with points, lines lying in same plane and
different geometrical entities related to them, is known
as plane Geometry. In this textbook, plane geometry
is the matter of our discussion. Hence, whenever M
something is not mentioned in particular, we will
assume that all discussed points, lines etc lie in a plane.
Proof of Mathematical statements
In any mathematical theory different statements related to the theory are logically
established on the basis of some elementary concepts, definitions and postulates.
Such statements are generally known as propositions. In order to prove correctness
of statements some methods of logic are applied. The methods are:

1. Mathematical Induction

2. Mathematical Deduction

3. Proof by contradiction etc.
Proof by contradiction
Philosopher Aristotle first introduced this method of logical proof. The basis of
this method is:

1. A property cannot be accepted and rejected at the same time.

2. The same object cannot possess opposite properties.

3. One cannot think of anything which is contradictory to itself.

4. If an object attains some property, that object cannot unattain that property

at the same time.

Geometric proof
In geometry, special importance is attached to some propositions which are
taken as theorems and used successively in establishing other propositions. In
geometric proof different statements are explained with the help of figures.
But the proof must be logical.
In describing geometric propositions general or particular enunciation is used.
The general enunciation is the description independent of the figure and the
particular enunciation is the description based on the figure. If the general
enunciation of a proposition is given, subject matter of the proposition is
specified through particular enunciation. For this, necessary figure is to be
drawn.
Generally, in proving the geometric theorem the following steps should be
followed :
1. General enunciation.
2. Figure and particular enunciation.
3. Description of the necessary constructions and
4. Description of the logical steps of the proof.
If a proposition is proved directly from the conclusion of a theorem, it is called
a corollary of that theorem. Besides, proof of various propositions, proposals for
construction of different figures are considered. These are known as constructions.
By drawing figures related to problems, it is necessary to narrate the description
of construction and its logical truth.

Line, Ray, Line Segment
By postulates of plane geometry, every point of a straight line lies in a plane. Let
AB be a line in a plane and C be a point on it. The point C' is called internal to A
and B if the points A, C' and B are different points on a line and AC'+CB = AB.
The points A, C and B are also called collinear points. The set of points including
A and B and all the internal points is known as the line segment AB. The points
between A and B are called internal points.

Angle
When two rays in a plane meet at a point, an angle
is formed. The rays are known as the sides of the
angle and the common point as vertex. In the figure, P
two rays OP and OQ make an angle ZPOQ at their
common point O. O is the vertex of the angle ZPOQ.
The set of all points lying in the plane on the @ side 5 2
of OP and P side of OQ is known as the interior
region of the ZPOQ. The set of all points not lying
in the interior region or on any side of the angle is
called exterior region of the angle.

Straight angle
The angle made by two opposite rays at their
common end point is a straight angle. In the adjacent
figure, a ray AC is drawn from the end point A of the «<o———e—e—>
ray AB. Thus the rays AB and AC have formed an ¢ A B
angle ZBAC at their common point A. ZBAC is a
straight angle. The measurement of a right angle is
2 right angles or 180°.
Adjacent angle
If two angles in a plane have the same vertex, a
common side and the angles lie on opposite sides of B c
the common side, each of the two angles is said to be
an adjacent angle of the other.
In the adjacent figure, the angles ZBAC and ZCAD
have the same vertex A, a common side AC and A D
are on opposite sides of AC. ZBAC and ZC AD are
adjacent angles.
Perpendicular and Right angle
If two adjacent angles are on the same line and equal,
then each of the related adjacent angle is a right
angle or 90° : The two sides of a right angle are mutually
perpendicular. In the adjacent figure two angles Cc
ZBAC and ZDAC are produced at the point A of
BD by the ray AC. A is the vertex of these two
angles.
AC is the common side of the angles ZBAC and B A D
ZDAC. The tow angles lie on the tow sides of the
common side AC. If ZBAC and ZDAC are equal,
then each of the two angles is right angle. The line
segments AC and BD are mutually perpendicular.

Acute angle and obtuse angle B c
An angle which is less than a right angle is called an /

Two angles are said to be the opposite angles if the

sides of one are the opposite rays of the other. h 5

In the adjoining figure OA and OB are mutually

opposite rays. So are the rays OC and OD. The

angles ZBOD and ZAOC are a pair of opposite 0

angles.

Similarly, ZBOC and ZDOA are another pair of c B
opposite angles. Therefore, two intersecting lines

produce two pairs of opposite angles.

Theorem 1. The sum of the two adjacent angles which a ray makes with a
straight line on its meeting point is equal to two right angles.

Let, the ray OC meets the straight line AB at O. As

a result two adjacent angles ZAOC and ZCOB are D C

In the figure, two straight lines AB and C'D are cut by a straight line EF at P
and Q. The straight line EF is a traversal of AB and C'D. The traversal has
made eight angles Z1, £2, /3, Z4, /5, Z6, Z7, Z8 with the lines AB and CD.
Among the angles

1) Z1 and £5, £2 and £6, £3 and £7, Z4 and £8 are corresponding angles.

2) /3 and £6, Z4 and Z5 are alternate angles.

3) Z4, Z6 are interior angles on the right.

4) £3, £5 are interior angles on the left.

In a plane two straight lines may intersect or they are parallel. The lines intersect
if there exists a point which is common to both lines. Otherwise, the lines are
parallel. Note that two different straight lines may at most have only one point
in common.

The parallelism of two straight lines in a plane may be defined in three different
ways:

1) The two straight lines never intersect each other ( even if extended to

infinity).

2) Every point on one line lies at equal smallest distance from the other.

3) The corresponding angles made by a transversal of the pair of lines are equal.
According to definition (a) in a plane two straight lines are parallel, if they do
not intersect each other. Two line segments taken as parts of the parallel lines are
also parallel.

According to definition (b) the perpendicular distance of any point of one of the
parallel lines from the other is always equal. Perpendicular distance is the length
of the perpendicular from any point on one of the lines to the other. Conversely,
if the perpendicular distances of two points on any of the lines to the other are
equal, the lines are parallel. This perpendicular distance is known as the distance
of the parallel lines.
The definition (¢) is equivalent to the fifth postulate of Euclid. This definition is
more useful in geometric proof and constructions.
Observe that, through a point not on a line, a unique line parallel to it can be
drawn.
Euclid’s 5th Postulate (presented by graph)
When a transversal cuts two parallel straight lines,
1) the pair of corresponding angles are equal.

Triangle
A triangle is a figure closed by three line segments. The line segments are known
as sides of the triangle. The point common to any pair of sides is the vertex. The
sides form angles at the vertices.
A triangle has three sides and three angles. Triangles are classified by sides into
three types: equilateral, isosceles and scalene.
By angles triangles are also classified into three types: acute angled, right angled
and obtuse angled.
The sum of the lengths of three sides of the triangle is the perimeter. By triangle
we also denote the region closed by the sides. The line segment drawn from a
vertex to the mid-point of opposite side is known as the median. Again, the
perpendicular distance from any vertex to the opposite side is the height of the
triangle. I.

equilateral triangle; because, AB = BC = CA ie,
the lengths of three sides are equal. i ©

Isosceles triangle
An isosceles triangle is triangle with two equal sides.
In the adjacent figure triangle ABC is an isosceles
triangle; because AB = AC # BC' i.e. the lengths
of only two sides are equal. Is c
Scalene triangle A
Sides of scalene triangle are unequal. Triangle ABC'

BC, C'A are unequal B Cc
Acute triangle A
A triangle having all the three angles acute is acute
angled triangle. In the triangle ABC each of the
angles ZBAC, ZABC, ZBCA is acute i.e., the # ¢
measurement of any angle is less than 90°. So AABC
is acute angled.
Right triangle
A triangle with one of the angles right is a right 2
angled triangle. In the figure, the ZDFE is a right
angle; each of the two other angles ZDEF and

Interior and Exterior Angles
If a side of a triangle is produced, a new angle is formed. This angle is known
as exterior angle. Except the angle adjacent to the exterior angle, the two others
angles of the triangle are known as opposite interior angles.
In the adjacent figure, the side BC of AABC is A
extended to D. The angle ZAC'D is an exterior angle
of the triangle. ZABC', ZBAC and ZACB are three
interior angles. ZACB is the adjacent interior angle 5 = D

Practical Geometry
In the previous classes geometrical figures were drawn in proving different
propositions and in the exercises. There was no need for precision in drawing
these figures. But sometimes precision is necessary in geometrical constructions.
For example, when an architect makes a design of a house or an engineer draws
different parts of a machine, high precision of drawing is required. In such
geometrical constructions, one makes use of ruler and compasses only. We have
already learnt how to construct triangles and quadrilaterals with the help of
ruler and compasses. In this chapter we will discuss the construction of some
special triangles and quadrilaterals.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —

» explain triangles and quadrilaterals with the help of figures

» construct triangle by using given data

» construct quadrilateral, parallelogram, trapezium by using given data.
Construction of Triangles
Every triangle has three sides and three angles. But, to specify the shape and
size of a triangle, all sides and angles need not to be specified. For example, as
sum of the three angles of a triangle is two right angles, one can easily find the
measurement of the third angle when the measurement of the two angles of the
triangle is given. Again, from the theorems on congruence of triangles it is found that
the following combination of three sides and angles are enough to be congruent.
That is, a combination of these three parts of a triangle is enough to construct a
unique triangle. In class seven we have learnt how to construct triangles from the 5
following data: S

Observe that in each of the cases above, three parts of a triangle have been
specified. But any three parts do not necessarily specify a unique triangle. As for

the difference between the other two sides are given. Construct the triangle.

Construction of Quadrilaterals
We have seen if three independent data are given, in many cases it is possible
to construct a definite triangle. But with four given sides the construction of
a definite quadrilateral is not possible. Five independent data are required for
construction of a definite quadrilateral. A definite quadrilateral can be constructed
if any one of the following combinations of data is known :
1. Four sides and an angle
2. Four sides and a diagonal
3. Three sides and two diagonals
4. Three sides and two included angles
5. Two sides and three angles.
In class VIII, the construction of quadrilaterals with the above specified data has
been discussed. If we closely look at the steps of construction, we see that in some
cases it is possible to construct the quadrilaterals directly. In some cases, the
construction is done by constructions of triangles. Since a diagonal divides the
quadrilateral into two triangles, when one or two diagonals are included in data,
construction of quadrilaterals is possible through construction of triangle.

Sometimes special quadrilaterals can be constructed with fewer data. In such a
case, from the properties of quadrilaterals, we can retrieve five necessary data.
For example, a parallelogram can be constructed if only the two adjacent sides
and the included angle are given. In this case, only three data are given. Again,
a square can be constructed when only one side of the square is given. The four
sides of a square are equal and an angle is a right angle; so five data are easily
specified.

parallelogram are given. Construct the parallelogram.

Circle
‘We have already known that a circle is a geometrical figure in a plane consisting
of points equidistant from a fixed point. Different concepts related to circles like
centre, diameter, radius, chord etc have been discussed in previous class. In this
chapter, the propositions related to arcs and tangents of a circle in the plane will
be discussed.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to

» explain arcs, angle at the centre, angle in the circle, quadrilaterals inscribed

in the cirlce

» prove theorems related to circle

» apply of the theorems to solve many problems related to circle

» state constructions related to circle.
Circle
A circle is a geometrical figure in a plane whose points are equidistant from a
fixed point. The fixed point is the centre of the circle. The closed path traced by
a point that keeps it distance from the fixed centre is a circle. The distance from
the centre is the radius of the circle.
Let, O be a fixed point in a plane and r be a fixed
measurement. The set of points which are at a ¢
distance 7 from O is the circle with centre O and IN)
radius 7. In the figure, O is the centre of the circle n B
and A, B and C' are three points on the circle. Each
of OA, OB and OC is a radius of the circle.
Some coplanar points are called concylcic if a circle passes through these points,
i.e. there is a circle on which all these points lie. In the above figure, the points io
A, B and C' are concyclic. S


--- Page 170 ---
Chapter 8. Circle 165
Interior and Exterior of a Circle
If O is the centre of a circle and 7 is its radius, the set
of all points on the plane whose distances from O are
less than 7 is called the interior region of the circle
and the set of all points on the plane whose distances
from O are greater than r is called the exterior region R Q
of the circle. The line segment joining two points of
a circle lies inside the circle.
The line segment drawn from an interior point to an exterior point of a circle
intersects a circle at one and only one point. In the figure, P is the interior point
and @Q is the exterior point of the circle. The line segment PQ intersects the circle
at R only.
Chord and diameter of a circle
The line segment connecting two different points of
a circle is a chord of the circle. If the chord passes
through the centre, it is known as diameter. That
is, any chord forwarding to the centre of the circle is B
diameter. In the figure, AB and AC" are two chords Cc
and O is the centre of the circle. The chord AC is
a diameter, since it passes through the centre. OA A
and OC are two radii of the circle. Therefore, the
centre of a circle is the midpoint of any diameter.
The length of a diameter is 2r, where r is the radius
of the circle.
Theorem 17. The line segment drawn from the centre of a circle to bisect a
chord other than diameter is perpendicular to the chord.
Let AB be a chord (other than diameter) of a circle C
ABC with center O and M be the midpoint of the
chord. Join O, M. Tt is to be proved that the line
segment OM is perpendicular to the chord AB.
Drawing: Join O, A and O, B. A B

The arc of a circle
An arc is the piece of the circle between any two
points of the circle. Look at the pieces of the circle
between two points A and B in the figure. We find
that there are two pieces, one comparatively larger
and the other smaller. The larger one is called the ()
major arc and the smaller one is called the minor A B
arc. A and B are the terminal points of this arc R
and all other points are its internal points. With an Cy
internal fixed point R the arc is called arc ARB and A B
is expressed by the symbol ARB. Again, sometimes Hb
minor arc is expressed by the symbol AB. The two
points A and B of the circle divide the circle into two
arcs. The terminal points of both arcs are A and B
and there is no other common point of the two arcs
other than the terminal points.
Arc cut by an Angle
An angle is said to cut an arc of a circle if
1. each terminal point of the arc lies on the sides
of the angle,
2. cach side of the angle contains at least one A B
terminal point and P
3. Every interior point of the arc lies inside the
angle. The angle shown in the figure cuts the
APB arc of the circle with centre O.

Angle in a Circle (Inscribed angle)

If two chords of a circle meet at a point on the circle

then the angle formed between these chords is called

circular angle or angle inscribed in a circle.

In the figure, ZACB is an angle in a circle. Every c

angle in a circle cuts an arc of the circle. This arc

may be a major or minor arc or a semi-circle.

The angle in a circle cuts an arc of the circle and

the angle is said to be standing on the cut off arc. 8

The angle is also known as the angle inscribed in the A Pr

conjugate arc.

In the adjacent figure, the angle stands on the arc

APB and is inscribed in the conjugate arc ACB.

It is to be noted that, APB and ACB are mutually

conjugate.

Remarks: The angle inscribed in an arc of a circle is the angle with vertex in

the arc and the sides passing through the terminal points of the arc. An angle

standing on an arc is the angle inscribed in the conjugate arc.

Angle at the Centre (Central angle)

The angle with vertex at the centre of the circle is

called an angle at the centre. An angle at the centre

cuts an arc of the circle and is said to stand on the

arc. In the adjacent figure, ZAOB is an angle at the

centre and it stands on the arc APB. Every angle A

at the centre stands on a minor arc of the circle. In 7 B

the figure APB is the minor arc. So the vertex of an A

angle at the centre always lies at the centre and the

sides pass through the two terminal points of the arc. ZN c

To consider an angle at the centre standing on a semi- 8

circle the above description is not meaningful. In the NEY

case of semicircle, the angle at the centre ZBOC' is

a straight angle and the angle on the arc ZBAC' is a

right angle.

Theorem 20. The angle subtended by the same arc at the centre is double of
the angle subtended by it at any point on the remaining part of the circle.
Given an arc BC of a circle subtending angles ZBOC'

at the centre O and ZBAC at a point A of the circle A

ABC.

‘We need to prove that ZBOC = 2/BAC

Drawing: Suppose, the line segment AC’ does not

pass through the centre. In this case, draw a line B

segment AD at A passing through the centre.

Proof:

Step 1. In AAOB the external angle ZBOD = /BAO + ZABO [An
exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite
angles]

Step 2. In AAOB, OA =0B [- Radius of same circle]

Therefore, ZBAO = ZABO [.- Base angles of an isosceles triangle are
equal]

Step 3. From steps (1) and (2), ZBOD = 2/BAO

Step 4. Similarly, from AAOC, ZCOD = 2/CAO

Step 5. From steps (3) and (4),

ZBOD + ZC0D = 2/BA0O +2/C AO [by adding]
This is the same as ZBOC = 2/BAC (Proved)

We can state the theorem in a different way. The angle standing on an arc of the

circle is half the angle subtended by the arc at the centre.

‘Work: Prove the theorem 20 when AC passes through the centre O of the
circle ABC.

Theorem 21. Angles in a circle standing on the same arc are equal.

Let O be the centre of a circle and standing on the

arc BOD, ZBAD and ZBED be the two angles in

Theorem 23. The sum of the two opposite angles of a quadrilateral inscribed
in a circle is two right angles.
Let ABCD be a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle D
with centre O. It is required to prove that, ZABC +
ZADC = 2 right angles and /BAD + /BCD = 2 A c
right angles.
Drawing: Join O, A and O,C'. B
Proof:
Step 1. Standing on the same arc ADC, the angle at centre reflex
ZAOC = 2 (ZABCat the circumference)
that is, reflex ZAOC' = 2ZABC' [The angle subtended by an arc at the centre
is double of the angle subtended by it at the circle]
Step 2. Again, standing on the same arc ABC, the angle at the centre ZAOC = 2
(£ZADC at the circumference)
that is, ZAOC' = 2/ADC [The angle subtended by an arc at the
centre is double of the angle subtended by it at the circle]
coreflex ZAOC+ ZAOC = 2(ZABC + ZADC)
But reflex ZAOC+ ZAOC = 4 right angles
:.2(LABC + ZADC') = 4 right angles
» LABC + ZADC = 2 right angles
In the same way, it can be proved that ZBAD + ZBCD = 2 right angles.

Theorem 24. If two opposite angles of a quadrilateral are supplementary, the
four vertices of the quadrilateral are concyclic.

Let ABCD be the quadrilateral with ZABC +

ZADC = 2 right angles. It is required to prove that gD

the four points A, B, C', D are concyclic.

Drawing: Since the points A, B, C are not A c
collinear, there exists a unique circle which passes

through these three points. Let the circle intersect B

AD at E. Join C, E.

Proof: ABCE is a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle.

Therefore, ZABC + ZAEC = 2 right angles. [The sum of the two opposite angles
of an inscribed quadrilateral is two right angles.]

But ZABC + ZADC = 2 right angles. [given]

CS LAEC = LADC

But this is impossible, since in ACED, exterior ZAEC' > opposite interior ZADC'

Consider the relative position of a circle and a straight line in the plane. Three
possible situations of the following given figures may arise in such a case:

A circle and a straight line in a plane may at best have two points of intersection.
If a circle and a straight line in a plane have two points of intersection, the straight
line is called a secant to the circle and if the point of intersection is one and only
one, the straight line is called a tangent to the circle. In the latter case, the
common point is called the point of contact of the tangent. In the above figure,
the relative position of a circle and a straight line is shown. 9

In figure (i) the circle and the straight line PQ have no common point; in figure
(ii) the line PQ is a secant, since it intersects the circle at two points A and B
and in figure (iii) the line PQ has touched the circle at A. PQ is a tangent to the
circle and A is the point of contact of the tangent.
Remarks: All the points between two points of intersection of every secant of
the circle lie interior of the circle.
Common tangent
If a straight line is a tangent to two circles, it is
called a common tangent to the two circles. In the
adjoining figures, AB is a common tangent to both
the circles. In figure (a) and (b), the points of contact < r
are different. In figure (c) and (d), the points of (a)
contact are the same.
If the two points of contact of the common tangent
to two circles are different, the tangent is said to be a B

1) direct common tangent if the two centres of the

circles lie on the same side of the tangent and ®
2) transverse common tangent, if the two centres
lie on opposite sides of the tangent.

The tangent in figure (a) is a direct common one and P
in figure (c) it is a transverse common tangent.
If a common tangent to a circle touches both the
circles at the same point, the two circles are said ©
to touch each other at that point. In such a case,
the two circles are said to have touched internally or
externally according to their centres lie on the same oS
side or opposite side of the tangent. In figure (c) the
two circles have touched each other internally and in 3
figure (d) externally. @

OQ is greater than OP that is, OQ > OP and it is true for every point ) on

Remarks:

1. If two circles touch each other externally, all the points of one excepting the

2. If two circles touch each other internally, all the points of the smaller circle

Theorem 27. If two circles touch each other externally, the point of contact of

the tangent and the centres are collinear.

Let the two circles with centres at A and B touch

cach other externally at O. It is required to prove r

that the points A, O, B are collinear.

Drawing: Since the given circles touch each other

at O,they have a common tangent at the point O.

Now draw the common tangent POQ at O and join 0

Proof:

In the circles with the centre A, OA is the radius through the point of contact of

the tangent and POQ is the tangent.

Therefore ZPOA = 1 right angle. Similarly ZPOB = 1 right angle.

ZPOA + ZPOB = 1 right angle + 1 right angle = 2 right angles

Constructions related to circles
Construction 6. To determine the centre of a circle or an arc of a circle.
Given a circle as in figure (a) or an arc of a circle as
in figure (b). It is required to determine the centre of
the circle or the arc.
Drawing: In the given circle or the arc of the circle,
three different points A, B and C are taken.
Join A, B and B, C'. The perpendicular bisectors J
EF and GH of the chords AB and BC are drawn
respectively. Let the bisectors intersect at (. (Circle ©): Are
Threfore, the O is the required centre of the circle Cc
or of the arc of the circle.
Proof: By construction, the line segment EF is the A
perpendicular bisector of chord AB and GH is the A B
perpendicular bisector of chord BC. But both EF x
and GH pass through the centre and their common
point is O. Therefore, the point O is the centre of
the circle or of the arc of the circle.
Tangents to a Circle
‘We have known that a tangent can not be drawn to a circle from a point internal
to it. If the point is on the circle, a single tangent can be drawn at that point. The
tangent is perpendicular to the radius drawn from the specified point. Therefore,
in order to construct a tangent to a circle at a point on it, it is required to construct
the radius from the point and then construct a perpendicular to it. Again, if the
point is located outside the circle, two tangents to the circle can be constructed.
Construction 7. To draw a tangent at any point of a circle.
Let A be a point of a circle whose centre is O. Tt is
required to draw a tangent to the circle at the point A.
Drawing: O, A are joined. At the point A, a
perpendicular AP is drawn to OA. Then AP is the
required tangent.
Proof: The line segment OA is the radius passing Pp
through A and AP is perpendicular to it. Hence AP A

- is the required tangent.

g Note : At any point of a circle only one tangent can be drawn.


--- Page 187 ---
182 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Construction 8. To draw a tangent to a circle from a point outside.
Let P be a point outside of a circle whose centre is
O. A tangent is to be drawn to the circle from the
point P. A
Drawing: p=
1. Join P,O. The middle point M of the line 7
segment PO is determined. P
2. Now with M as centre and MO as radius, a J
circle is drawn. Let the new circle intersect the |
given circle at the points A and B. B
3. Join A, P and B, P.
Then both AP, BP are the required tangents.
Proof: A, O and B, O are joined. PO is the diameter of the circle APB.
:. ZPAO = 1 right angle ['.- the angle inscribed in the semi-circle is a right
angle]
So the line segment OA is perpendicular to AP. Therefore, the line segment AP
is a tangent at A to the circle with centre at O. Similarly, the line segment BP is
also a tangent to the circle.
Nota Bene: Two and only two tangents can be drawn to a circle from an external
point.
Construction 9. To draw a circle circumscribing a given triangle.
Let ABC be a triangle. It is required to draw a
circle circumscribing it. That is, a circle which passes 4
through the three vertices A, B and C' of the triangle
is to be drawn. M
Drawing:
1. EM and FN, the perpendicular bisectors of AB
and AC respectively are drawn. Let the line
segments intersect each other at O. B c
2. A 0 are joined. With O as centre and radius
equal to OA, a circle is drawn.
Then the circle will pass through the points A, B and C and this circle is the
required circumcircle of AABC. g


--- Page 188 ---
Chapter 8. Circle 183
Proof: B,0 and C,O are joined. The point O stands on EM, the perpendicular
bisector of AB.
.OA = OB, Similarly, OA = OC
OA=0B=0C
Hence, the circle drawn with O as the centre and OA as the radius passes through
the three points A, B and C'. This circle is the required circumcircle of AABC.
Work: In the above figure, the circumcircle of an acute angled-triangle is
constructed. Construct the circumcircle of an obtuse and right-angled
triangles.
Notice that for in obtuse-angled triangle, the circumcentre lies outside the
triangle, in acute-angled triangle, the circumcentre lies within the triangle and in
right-angled triangle, the circumcentre lies on the hypotenuse of the triangle.
Construction 10. To draw a circle inscribed in a triangle.
Let AABC be a triangle. It is required to draw am
inscribed circle. that is, to inscribe a circle in it or to
draw a circle in it such that it touches each A
of the three sides BC, CA and AB of AABC. JAN E
Drawing: BL and C'M, the bisectors respectively F, Lo;
of the angles ZABC and ZACB are drawn. Let Vi ON
the line segments intersect at O. OD is drawn AdbaxN
perpendicular to BC' from O and let it intersect BC'  B C
at D. With O as centre and OD as radius, a circle
is drawn. Then, this circle is the required inscribed
circle.
Proof: From O, OF and OF are drawn perpendiculars respectively to AC" and
AB. Let these two perpendiculars intersect the respective sides at E and F'.
The point O lies on the bisector of ZABC.
SOF =0D
Similarly, as O lies on bisector of ZACB, OE = OD
0D =0FE=0F
- Hence, the circle drawn with centre as O and OD as radius passes through D,
a
Sand F.


--- Page 189 ---
184 Mathematics Classes IX-X

Again, OD, OF and OF respectively are perpendiculars to BC, AC and AB at

their extremities.

Hence, the circle lying inside AABC' touches its sides at the points D, E and F'

respectively.

Hence, the circle DEF is the required inscribed circle of AABC'

Construction 11. To draw an ex-circle of a given triangle.

Let ABC be a triangle. It is required to draw its

ex-circle. That is, to draw a circle which touches one F

side of triangle and the other two sides produced.

Drawing: Let AB and AC be produced to D and L

F respectively. BM and CN, the bisectors of ZDBC

and ZF CB respectively are drawn. Let E be their C

point of intersection. From FE, perpendicular FH is

drawn on BC and let EH intersects BC at H. With

FE as centre and radius equal to EH, a circle is drawn. A BG D

The circle FIG L is the ex-circle of the triangle ABC.

Proof: From E, perpendiculars EG and EL respectively are drawn to line

segments BD and CF.Let the perpendicular intersect line segments BD and

C'F at the point G and L respectively.

Since E lies on the bisector of ZDBC' -. EH = EG

Similarly, the point FE lies on the bisector of ZFCB, so, EH = EL

EH =FEG=EL

Hence, the circle drawn with E as centre and radius equal to E'L passes through

H, Gand L.

Again, the line segments BC, BD and C'F respectively are perpendiculars at the

extremities of EH, EG and EL.

Hence, the circle touches the three line segments at the three points H, G and L.

Therefore, the circle HGL is the ex-circle of AABC'.

Remarks: Three ex-circles can be drawn with any triangle. |

Trigonometric Ratio
In our day to day life we make use of triangles, and in particular, right-angled
triangles. Many different examples from our surroundings can be drawn where
right triangles can be imagined to be formed. In ancient times, with the help
of geometry men learnt the technique of determining the width of a river by
standing on its bank. Without climbing the tree they knew how to measure the
height of the tree accurately by comparing its shadow with that of a stick. In all
the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using some
mathematical technique which come under a special branch of mathematics called
Trigonometry. The word “Trigonometry” is derived from Greek words ‘tri’ (means
three), ‘gon’ (means edge) and ‘metron’ (means measure). In fact, trigonometry
is the study of relationship between the sides and angles of a triangle. There are
evidence of using the Trigonometry in Egyptian and Babilonian civilization. It is
believed that the Egyptians made its extensive use in land survey and engineering
works. Early astrologers used it to determine the distances from the Earth to
the farthest planets and stars. At present trigonometry is in use in all branches
of mathematics. There are wide used of trigonometry for the solution of triangle
related problems and in navigation etc. Now a days trigonometry is in wide use
in Astronomy and Calculus.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to —
» describe the trigonometric ratios of acute angles.
» determine the mutual relations among the trigonometric ratios of acute
angle.
» solve and prove the mathematical problems justifying the trigonometric
ratios of acute angle.
» determine and apply trigonometric ratios of acute angles 30°, 45°, 60°

Naming of sides of a right-angled triangle
We know that, the sides of right-angle triangle are known as hypotenuse, base
and height. This is successful for the horizontal position of triangle. Again, the
naming of sides is based on the position of one of the two acute angles of right-
angled triangle. As for example :
1. ‘(hypotenuse)’ the side of a right-angled triangle, which is the opposite side
of the right angle.
2. ‘(opposite side)’, which is the direct opposite side of a given angle.
3. ‘(adjacent side)’, which is a line segment constituting the given angle.
P, P,
[&] N [e} N
For the angle ZPON, OP is the
hypotenuse, ON is the adjacent side
and PN is the opposite side. For the
angle ZOPN, OP is the hypotenuse,
PN is the adjacent side and ON is the
opposite side.
In the geometric figure, the capital letters are used to indicate the vertices and
small letters are used to indicate the sides of a triangle. We often use the Greek
letters to indicate angle. Widely used six letters of Greek alphabet are :
beta 7 fia 0
Greek letter are used in geometry and trigonometry through all the great
mathematician of ancient Greek.

Let ZX OA is an acute angle. We take a point P on

the side OA. We draw a perpendicular PM from P Pi A

to OX. As a result, a right-angled triangle POM is

formed. The three ratios of the sides PM, OM and Ls

point P on the side OA.

If we draw the perpendiculars PM and PM; from a

two points P and Py to the side OX, two similar ¢y M Mi xX

Trigonometric ratios of an acute angle
Let ZXOA be an acute angle. We take any point
P on OA. We draw a perpendicular PM from the
point P to OA. A right angled triangle POM is formed. A
The six ratios are obtained from the sides PM, OM
and OP of APOM which are called trigonometric L
ratios of the angle ZXOA and each of them are
named particularly. With respect to the ZXOA of
right-angled triangle POM, PM is the opposite side, pa ~
OM is the adjacent side and OP is the hypotenuse.
Denoting ZXOA = 0, the obtained six ratios are
described below for the angle 6.

Trigonometric ratios for the angles 30°, 45°, and 60°.

Trigonometric ratios of complementary angles
We know, if the sum of two acute angles is 90°, one of them is called
complementary angle to the other. For example, 30° and 60° and 15° and 75° are
complementary angles to each other.
In general, the angles 6 and (90° — #) are complementary angles to each other.
Let ZXOY = 6 and P is the point on the side OY y
of the angle. We draw PM 1 OX.
Since the sum of the three angles of a triangle is two L
right angles, therefore, in the right angled triangle d
POM, ZPMO = 90°

Trigonometric ratios of the angles 0° and 90°
We have learnt how to determine the trigonometric r
ratios for the acute angle 6 of aright-angled triangle. Now,
we see, if the angle is made gradually smaller, how
the trigonometric ratios change. As 6 get smaller
the length of the side, PN also gets smaller. The
point P closes to the point N and finally the angle 0 N
6 comes closer to the angle 0°, OP is reconciled with
ON approximately.
P

When the angle # comes closer to 0°, the length of the line segment PN reduces to
PN
zero and in this case the value of sinf = oP is approximately zero. At the same
ON
time, the length of OP is equal to the length of ON and the value of cos 0 = oP
is 1 approximately.
The angle, 0° is introduced for the convenience of discussion in trigonometry, and
the edge line and the original line of the angle 0° are supposed the same ray.
Therefore, in line with the prior discussion, it is said that, cos 0° = 1, sin 0° = 0

Again, when the angle 6 is very closed to 90°, hypotenuse OP is approximately
equal to PN. So the value of sinf is approximately 1.on the other hand, if the
angle 0 is equal to 90°, ON is nearly zero; the value of cos 0 is approximately 0.
So, in agreement of formulae that are described above, we can say, cos 90° = 0,

Distance and Elevation
From very ancient times trigonometric ratios are applied to find the distance and
height of any distant object. At present trigonometric ratios are of boundless
importance because of its increasing usage. The heights of the hills, mountains
towers, trees and the widths of those rivers which cannot be measured in ordinary
method are measured with the help of trigonometry. It is necessary to know the
trigonometrical ratios values of acute angles in this regard.
At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to —
» explain the geoline, vertical plane and angles of elevation and declination.
» solve mathematical problem related to distance and height with the help of
trigonometry.
» measure practically different types of distances and heights with the help of
trigono etry.
Horizontal Line, Vertical Line and Vertical Plane
A horizontal line is a straight line on the horizontal plane. A straight line parallel
to horizon is also called a horizontal line. A vertical line is a line perpendicular
to the horizontal plane. It is also called a normal line. A horizontal line and a
vertical line intersected at right angles on the plane define a plane. It is known as
vertical plane.
A
In the figure, a tree with height of AB is standing vertically
at a distance of C'B from a point C' on the horizontal plane.
Here, C'B is the horizontal line. BA is the vertical line and
the plane ABC is perpendicular to the horizontal plane which
is a vertical plane.

Algebraic Ratio and Proportion
It is important for us to have a clear conception of ratio and proportion in
mathematics. Arithmetical ratio and proportion have been elaborately discussed
in class VIL. In this chapter, algebraic ratio and proportion will be discussed. We
regularly use the concept of ratio and proportion in many applications: the
production of construction materials, food staff and goods , applying fertilizer in
land, making beautiful shapes and design to make things attractive and good
looking, and so on. Many problems of daily lives can also be solved by using the
concept of ratio and proportion.
After studying this chapter, the students will be able to
» exp ain algebraic ratio and proportion.
» use different types of rules of transformation related to proportion.
» learn successive proportion.
» use ratio, proportion, successive proportion in solving real life problems.
Ratio and Proportion
Ratio
If we have two quantities (or numbers) of the same unit, we can express one
quantity as a multiple (or a fraction) of the other quantity. This fraction is called
the ratio of two quantities. Thus, a ratio says how much of one thing there is
compared to another thing.
The ratio of two quantities p and ¢ is written as p: ¢ = P These two quantities,
q
p and ¢ are of same kind and same unit. Here, p is called antecedent and ¢ is
. g
called subsequent of the ratio. 8


--- Page 228 ---
Chapter 10. Distance and Elevation 223
Sometimes we use the ratio as an approximate measure. For example, the number
of cars on the road at 10 A.M. is two times higher than the number of cars at
8 AM. In this case, it is not necessary to know the exact number of cars to
determine the ratio. Again, in many occasions, we say that the area of your house
is three times to the area of mine. Also in this case, it is not necessary to know
the exact area of the house. We use the concept of ratio in many other cases of
practical life.
Proportion
If four quantities (or numbers), are such that the ratio of the first and the second
quantities is equal to the ratio of the third and the fourth quantities. those four
quantities form a proportion.If a, b, ¢, d are four such quantities, we write
a:b = c¢: d. The four quantities need not to be of same kind. The two quantities
of the ratio need to be of the same kind.
a b
In the above figure, let the bases of two triangles be a and b, respectively and
each of their height is / unit. If the areas of these triangle are A and B square
units, respectively, we can write.
1
A Fah,
2-2 _¢ or, A:B=a:b
B 1 b
Fh

i.e. the ratio of two areas is equal to the ratio of two bases.
Continued proportion
By continued proportion of a, b, ¢, it is meant that a : b=b: c. a,b,c will be
continued proportion, If and only if b2=ac. In case of continued proportional,
all the quantities are to be of same kind. In this case, ¢ is called the third
proportional of a and b, and b is called the mid-proportional of a and c.

Solution: Let the present age of father be a and that of the son be b.

So, by the conditions of first and second of the problems, we have,

a 7

—=—...(1

p=

a+5 8

—=—...(2

b+5 3 @

From equation(1),we get,

a=T.®

From equation(2),we get,

3(a+5)=8(b+5)

or, 3a + 15 = 8b + 40

or, 3a — 8b =40 — 15

7b .
or, 3 x 3 8b = 25 [by using(3)]

If two ratios are of the form a : b and b : ¢, they can be re-written in the form
a:b:c This is called continued ratio. Any two or more ratios can be expressed
in this form. It is noted that if two ratios are to be expressed in the form a:b: ¢,
the antecedent of the first ratio and the subsequent of the second ratio need to be
equal. For example, if two ratios 2 : 3 and 4 : 3 are to be put in the form a : b: ¢,
the subsequent quantity of the first ratio is to be made equal to the antecedent
quantity of the second ratio. That is, those quantities are to be made equal to
their L.C.M.

Proportional Division
Division of a quantity into fixed ratio is called proportional division.If S is to
be divided in a given ratio a : b: ¢ : d, dividing S by a+b+c+d, the parts a,b,c

Example 15. The area of a rectangular land is 12 hectors and length of its
diagonal is 500 metres. The ratio of length and breadth of this land to that of
other land are 3 : 4 and 2 : 3, respectively.
1) What is the area of the given land in square metre?
2) What is the area of the other land?
3) What is the breadth of the given land?
Solution:
1) We know, 1 hector = 10,000 square metres.
12 hectors = 12 x 10,000 = 120000 square metres
2) Given that, the ratio of length and breadth of the given land to that of other
land are 3 : 4 and 2 : 3, respectively.
Let length of the given land be 3z metres and breadth be 2y metres.
Therefore, the length of the other land is 4 metres and breadth is 3y metres.
.. the area of the given land is = 3x - 2y = 62y square metres and the area
of the other land is = 4x - 3y = 12zy square metres.
According to the given question, 6zy = 120000 or, zy = 20000 .. the area
of the other land is = 12zy = 12 x 20000 = 240000 square metres.
3) Let the length of the given land be 3x metres and the breadth be 2y metres.
Therefore, the length of its one diagonal is B22 + (29)? metres.
We get from the previous (b) problem, xy = 20000
According to the question, VB) + (29)? = 500
or, 92% + 4y* = 250000
or, (3x + 2y)? — 2 3x - 2y = 250000
or, (37 + 2y)? — 12zy = 250000
or, (3z + 2y)* — 12 x 20000 = 250000
or, (3x + 2y)? = 250000 + 240000
or, (3x + 2y)? = 490000
g or, 3x +2y = 700 --- (1)


--- Page 243 ---
238 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Again, (3z —2y)? = (3x +2y)* —4- 3x -2y
or, (3 —2y)? = (3 + 2y)% — 24ay
or, (3z — 2y)? = (700)% — 24 x 20000
or, (3x — 2y)* = 490000 — 480000
or, (3x — 2y)% = 10000
or, 3x —2y = 100 ...(2)
By subtracting (2) from (1) we get,
4y = 600 or, y = 150
.. the breadth of the given land is 2y = 2 x 150 = 300 metres.

Simple Simultaneous Equations in

Two Variables
[Prior knowledge of this chapter are attached to the Appendix at the end of this
book. At first the Appendix should be read / discussed. ]
For solving the mathematical problems, the most important topic of Algebra is
equation. In classes VI and VII, we have got the idea of simple equation and
have known how to solve the simple equation inone variable. In class VIII,
we have solved the simple simultaneous equations by the methods of substitution
and elimination and by graphs. We have also learnt how to form and solve simple
simultaneous equations related to real life problems. In this chapter, the idea of
simple simultaneous equations have been expanded and new methods of solution
have been discussed. Besides, in this chapter, solution by graphs and formation
of simultaneous equations related to real life problems and their solutions have
been discussed in detail.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to

» verify the consistency of simple simultaneous equations in two variables.

» verify the mutual dependence of two simple simultaneous equations in

two variables
» explain the method of cross-multiplication.
» form and solve simultaneous equations related to real life mathematical
problems.

» solve the simultaneous equations with two variables by graphs.
Simple simultaneous equations
Simple simultaneous equations means two simple equations in two variables
when they are presented together and the two variables are of same 5
characteristics. Such two equations together are also called system of simple — &

equations. In class VIII, we have solved such system of equations and learnt to
form and solve simultaneous equations related to real life problems. In this
chapter, these have been discussed in more details.
First, we consider the equation 2x 4 y = 12. This is a simple equation in two
variables.
In the equation, can we get such values of = and y on the left hand side for which
the sum of twice the first with the second will be equal to 12 of the right hand
side; that is, the equation will be satisfied by those two values?
Now, we fill in the following chart from the equation 2x-+y=12:
Value of y | Value of L.H.S (22 + y)
SATE
(ESTE)
Gro-1
ETE
(SS I ER I
The equation has infinite number of solutions. Among those, four solutions are:
(=2.16), (0,12), (3,6), (5,2).
Again, we fill in the following chart from another equation r —y = 3:
Value of y | Value of L.H.S (z —y)
25-3
EC BT NF
EE FF = SI
[ES EE TR
The equation has infinite number of solutions. Among those, four solutions are:
(=2.-5), (0,3), (3,0), (5,2).
If the two equations discussed above are considered together a system, both the
equations will be satisfied simultaneously only by (5,2). Both the equations will
not be satisfied simultaneously by any other values.
“ Therefore, the solution of the system of equations 2x +y = 12 and  —y = 3 is
IS
S  (@y=062).

1) As discussed earlier, the system of equations 3 has unique (only

the coefficient of and y (taking the ratio of the coefficients) of the two

equations, we get, 1 # —7 any equation of the system of equations cannot
be expressed in terms of the other. That is why, such systems of equations
are called mutually independent. In the case of consistent and mutually
independent system of equations, the ratios are not equal. In this case, the
constant terms need not to be compared.

2) Now we shall consider the system of equations . Can these

two equations be solved?
Here, if both sides of first equation are multiplied by 2, we shall get the
second equation. Again, if both sides of second equation are divided by
2, we shall get the first equation. That is, the two equations are mutually
dependent.
‘We know, the first equation has infinite number of solutions. So, the second
equation has also the same infinite number of solutions. Such systems of

Here, multiplying both sides of first equation by 2, we get, 4x + 2y = 24
second equation is, dz + 2y = 5
subtracting, 0 = 19 which is impossible.

So, we can say, such systems of equations cannot be solved. Such systems
of equations are inconsistent and mutually independent. Such systems of
equations have no solution.
Here, comparing the coefficients of 2 and y and constant terms from the two

Solution of simple simultaneous equations
We shall discuss the solutions of only the consistent and independent simple
simultaneous equations. Such system of equation has only one (unique) solution.
Here, four methods of solutions are discussed :
0 1. Method of substitution 2. Method of elimination 3. Method of cross-
5 multiplication 4. Graphical method.


--- Page 253 ---
248 Mathematics Classes IX-X
In class VIII, we have known how to solve by the methods of substitution and
elimination. Here, examples of one for each of these two methods are given.
Example 2. Solve by the method of substitution:

2u4+y=38

3 —-2y=5
Solution: Given equations are;

20 +y=28...(1)

3x —2y=5...(2)
From equation (1), y = 8 — 2x... (3)
Putting the value of y from equation (3) in equation (2) we get,
3x —2(8—2x)=5
or, 3x — 16 +42 =5
or, Tx =5+ 16
or, Tx = 21
or, x =3
Putting the value of z in equation (3) we get,
y=8-2x3
or,y=8—06
or, y =2
solution (x,y) = (3,2)
Substitution method: Conveniently from any of the two equations, value of
one variable is expressed in terms of the other variable and putting the obtained
value in the other equation, we get an equation in one variable. Solving
this equation, value of the variable can be found. This value can be put in any
of the equations. But, if it is put in the equation in which one variable has been
expressed in terms of the other variable, the solution will be easier. From this
equation, value of the other variable will be found. .

Example 3. Solve by the method of elimination:
2r+y=28
3r—-2y=5
Note: To show the difference between the methods of substitution and
elimination, same equations of example 2 have been taken in this example 3.
Solution: Given equations are:
2 +y=58...(1)
3r—2y=5...(2)
Multiplying both sides of equation (1) by 2, 4a + 2y = 16... (3)
Adding (2) and (3),
Tr =21
or,r=23
Putting the value of z in (1) we get,
2x34+y=28
or,y=8—6
or, y=2
.-. solution (x,y) = (3,2)
Elimination method: Conveniently one equation or both equations are
multiplied by such a number so that after multiplication, absolute values of the
coefficients of the same variable become equal. Then as per need, if the
equations are added or subtracted, the variable with equal coefficient will be
eliminated. Then, solving the obtained equation, the value of the existing
variable will be found. If that value is put conveniently in any of the given
equations, value of the other variable will be found.
Cross multiplication method:
We consider the following two equations:
mr +by+e=0...(1)
arr + boy + ca =0...(2)
Multiplying equation (1) by by and equation (2) by b; we get,
arbor + bibay + bac; = 0... (3)
ashy + biboy + byes = 0... (4)

Again, multiplying equation (1) by a, and equation (2) by a; we get,
ras + asbyy + craz = 0... (6)
razz + arbyy + coa1 = 0... (7)
Subtracting equation (7) from equation (6) we get,
(azby — arbe)y + craz — oa = 0
or, —(a1by — ashy = —(craz — c2a1)

or, ———— = ———_..(8

From (5) and (8) we get,

the method of cross- multiplication.
From the above relation between x and y we get,

Solving by using Graphical Method
In a simple equation in two variables, the relation of existing variables x and y
and can be expressed by picture. This picture is called the graph of that relation.
In the graph of such equation, there exist infinite number of points. Plotting a
few such points and joining them with each other, we get the graph.
Each of a simple simultaneous equations has infinite number of solutions. Graph
of each equation is a straight line. Coordinates of each point of the straight line
satisfies the equation. To indicate a graph, two or more than two points are
necessary.
Now we shall try to solve graphically the following system of equations:
2w+y=3...(1)

‘We observe in the graph, though each of the given equations has separately
infinite number of solutions, they have no common solution as system of
simultaneous equations. Further, we observe that the graphs of the two
equations are straight lines parallel to each other. That is, the lines will never
intersect each other. Therefore, there will be no common point of the lines. In
this case we say, such system of equations has no solution. We know, such
system of equations is inconsistent and independent of each other.

Now, we shall solve the system of two consistent and independent equations by
graphs. Graphs of two such equations in two variables intersect at a point.

Formation of simultaneous equations from real
life problems and solution
In everyday life, there occur some such mathematical problems which are easier
to solve by forming equations. For this, from the condition or conditions of the
problem, two mathematical symbols, mostly the variables x, y are assumed for
two unknown expressions. Two equations are to be formed for determining the
values of those unknown expressions. If the two equations thus formed are solved,
values of the unknown quantities will be found.
Example 12. If 5 is added to the sum of the two digits of a number consisting
of two digits, the sum will be three times the digits of the tens place. Moreover,
if the places of the digits are interchanged, the number thus found will be 9 less
than the original number. Find the number.
Solution: Let the digit of the tens place of the required number be x and its
digits of the units place is y. Therefore, the number is 102 + y.
.. by the 1st condition, = +y +5 = 3x... (1)
and by the 2nd condition, 10y 4+ = = (10x +) — 9...(2)
From equation (1) we get, y = 3x — x — 5, or, y = 2x — 5... (3)
Again, from equation (2) we get,
1W0y—y+a—100+9=0
or, 9y — 9x +9 =0
or,y—z+1=0
or, 2z — 5 — x + 1 = 0 [putting the value of y from equation (3) we get]
or, xr =4

Finite Series
The term ‘order’ is widely used in our day to day life. For example, the concept
of order is used to arrange the commodities in the shops, to arrange the events of
drama and ceremony, to keep the commodities in attractive way in the godown.
Again, to make many tasks easier and attractive, we use large to small, child to
old, light to heavy etc. types of order. Mathematical series have been originated
from these concepts of order. In this chapter, the relation between sequence and
series and contents related to them have been presented.
At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to —

» describe the sequence and series and determine the differences between them.

» explain finite series.

» form formulae for determining the fixed term of the series and the sum of
fixed numbers of terms and solve mathematical problems by applying the
formulae.

» determine the sum of squares and cubes of natural numbers.

» solve mathematical problems by applying different formulae of series.

» construct formulae to find the fixed term of a geometric progression and sum
of fixed numbers of terms and solve mathematical problems by applying the
formulae.

Sequence
Let us note the following relation:
1 2 3 4 cee n cee
1 1 4 1 1
2 4 6 3 A
Here, every natural number n is related to twice the number 2n. That means, the
set of positive even numbers {2,4,6,---} is obtained by a method from the set pS
of natural numbers {1,2,3,---}. This arranged set of even number is a sequence. 5


--- Page 276 ---
Chapter 12. Simple Simultaneous Equations in Two Variables 271
Hence, some quantities are arranged in a particular way such that the antecedent
and subsequent terms becomes related. The set of quantities arranged in such a
way is called a sequence.
The aforesaid relation is called a function and written as f(n) = 2n. The general
term of this sequence is 2n. The number of terms of any sequence is infinite. The
way of writing the sequence with the help of general term is:
{2n}, n=1,2,3,-- or, {2n};2] or, {2n}
The first quantity of the sequence is called the first term, the second quantity is
called second term, the third quantity is called the third term etc. The first term
of the sequence 1,3,5,7,-- is 1, the second term is 2, etc. Followings are the four
examples of sequence :

2) Each of you write a general term and then write the sequence.
Series
If the terms of a sequence are connected successively by + sign, a series is
obtained. Such as, 1 +3 +5 +74 --- is a series. The differences between any
two successive terms of the series are equal. Again, 24+4 +84 16+ --- is a
series. The ratio of two successive terms is equal. Hence, the characterstic of any
0 series depends upon the relation between its two successive terms. Among the
5 series, two important series are arithmetic series and geometric series.


--- Page 277 ---
272 Mathematics Classes IX-X
Arithmetic Series

If the difference between any two adjacent terms of a series is always equal, it is
called arithmetic series.

Example 1. 1+3+5+ 749+ 11 is a series. The first term of the series is 1,
the second term is 3, the third term is 5 etc.

Here, second term — first term = 3 — 1 = 2,

third term —second term = 5 — 3 = 2, fourth term — third term = 7 — 5 = 2,
fifth term — fourth term = 9 — 7 = 5, sixth term — fifth term = 11 — 9 =2
Hence, the series is an arithmetic series.

In this series, the difference between two terms is called common difference. The
common difference of the mentioned series is 2. The numbers of terms of the
series are fixed. That is why the series is finite series. It is to be noted that if
the terms of the series are not fixed, the series is called infinite series, such as,
1+4+7+10+--- is an infinite series. In an arithmetic series, the first term and
the common difference are generally denoted by a and d respectively. Then by
definition, if the first term is a, the second term is a + d, the third term is a + 2d
etc. Hence, the series will be a + (a +d) + (a + 2d) + ---.

Determining common term of an arithmetic series

Let the first term of an arithmetic series be a and the common difference be d.
Then the terms of the series are:

First term =a =a + (1 —1)d

Second term =a +d =a+ (2 —1)d

Third term = a +2d =a + (3 —1)d

Fourth term =a +3d = a+ (4 —1)d

sonth term = a+ (n—1)d

This nth term is called common term of arithmetic series. If the first term of =
an arithmetic series in a and common difference is d are known, all the terms of &


--- Page 278 ---
Chapter 13. Finite Series 273
the series can be determined successively by putting n = 1,2,3,4,--- in the nth
term.

Let the first term of an arithmetic series be 3 and the common difference be 2.
Then nth term of the series is = 3+ (n—1) x 2 = 2n + 1.

Work: If the first term of an arithmetic series is 5 and common difference
is 7, determine the first six terms, 22nd term, rth term and (2p + 1)th term.

Example 2. Of the series 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 + --- which term is 3837

Solution: The first term of the series a = 5, common difference d = 8 — 5 =
11-8=14-11=3

It is an arithmetic series.

Let, nth term of the series = 383

We know that, nth term = a + (n — 1)d

coa+(n—1)d=2383

or, 5+ (n—1)3 =383

or, 5+ 3n — 3 = 383

or, 3n =383 -5+3

or, 3n = 381

381

or, n= =

or, n= 127

127th term of the given series is 383

Sum of n terms of an arithmetic series

Let the first term of any arithmetic series be a, last term be p, common difference
be d, number of terms be n and sum of n terms be S,,.

Example 4. 14+2+3+4+ +99 = what?
Solution:
The first term of the series a = 1, common difference d = 2 — 1 = 1 and the last
term p = 99.
It is an arithmetic series.
Let the nth term of the series = 9
We know, nth term of an arithmetic progression = a + (n —1)d
coat (n—1)d=99
or, 14 (n—1)1=99
or, 1+n—-1=99
con =99
From (4) formula, the sum of first n-terms of an arithmetic series,

Example 6. Rashid deposits Tk. 1200 from his salary in the first month and
every subsequent month, he deposits Tk. 100 more than the previous month.
1) Express the aforesaid problem as a series upto n terms.
2) How much does he deposit in the 18 th month and how much does he deposit
in first 18 months?
3) In how many years does he deposit a total of Tk. 106200?
Solution:
1) As per the question, first term of the arithmetic series, a = 1200, common
difference d = 100
second term = 1200 + 100 = 1300
Third term = 1300 + 100 = 1400
n-th term = a + (n — 1)d =1200 4 (n — 1) 100=1100+100n
.. The series is 1200 4 1300 + 1400 + - - - + (1100+100n)
2) We know, n-th term =a + (n — 1)d
.". deposit in the 18 th month = a + (18 — 1)d = 1200 + 17 x 100 = 2900 Tk.
Again, summation of first n-terms = Hea + (n — 1)d}
.. deposit in first 18 months = Br x 1200 + (18 — 1) x 100} Tk.
=9(2400 + 1700) = 36900 Tk.
3) Let, he deposits 106200 Tk. in n months.
According to the question, aed + (n — 1)d} = 106200
or, 22 x 1200+ (n — 1) x 100} = 106200
or, n(2400 + 100n — 100) = 212400
or, 100n? + 2300n — 212400 = 0
or, n? 4+ 23n — 2124 = 0
or, n? + 59n — 36n — 2124 = 0
or, (n+59)(n — 36) = 0
So, n= —59 or, n = 36
Number of months cannot be negative. .

Geometric Series
If the ratio of any term and its antecedent term of any series is always equal i.e.,
if any term divided by its antecedent term, the quotient is always equal, the series
is called a geometric series and the quotient is called common ratio. Such as, of
the series 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 the first term is 2, the second term is 4, the third
term is 8, the fourth term is 16 and the fifth term is 32. Here,

. . 4
the ratio of the second term to the first term = 5= 2

. . 8
the ratio of the third term to the second term = i= 2

. . 16
the ratio of the fourth term to the third term = 3 = 2

Lo . 32
the ratio of the fifth term to the fourth term = 6= 2.
So, this series is a geometric series. In this series, the ratio of any term to its
antecedent term is always equal. The common ratio of the mentioned series is
2. The numbers of terms of the series are finite. That is why the series is finite
geometric series.
The geometric series is widely used in different areas of physical and
biological science, in organizations like Banks and Life Insurance etc,
and in different branches of technology.
If the numbers of terms are not fixed in a geometric series, it is called an infinite
geometric series. The first term of a geometric series is generally expressed by a
and common ratios by 7. So by definition, if the first term is a, the second term
is ar, the third term is ar? etc. Hence the series will be a + ar + ar? + ar® + ++.

of Tk. 120000. His yearly increment is Tk. 5000. 10% of his salary is deducted
every year for provident fund. At the end of year he deposits 12000 Tk. in a bank
at a compound interest of 12%. He will retire from the job on December 31, 2030.
1) Which series done the basic salary of Palash Sarker follow? Write down that series.
2) How much salary (in Tk.) would he receive in his entire job life excluding
the provident fund money?
3) What is the amount of total deposited money with interest in the bank by
December 31, 20317
Solution:
1) Basic salary of Palash Sarker follows arithmetic series.
The first term of the series a = 120000 and common difference = 5000
.. The second term = 120000 + 5000 = 125000
The third term = 125000 + 5000 = 130000
.. The series is, 120000 + 125000 + 130000 + - - -
2) The total amount of salary excluding the provident fund from January 2005
to December 31, 2030 i.e. (2030 — 2005 + 1) or, 26 years is:
(120000 — 10% of 120000) + (125000 — 10% of 125000) + (130000 — 10% of
130000) + -- -
= (120000 — 12000) + (125000 — 12500) + (130000 — 13000) + - - -
= 108000 + 112500 + 117000 + - - -
In this cane it is an arithmetic series whose first term, a =108000, common
difference d = 112500 — 108000 = 4500 and number of terms n = 26

Ratio, Similarity and Symmetry
For comparing two quantities, their ratios are to be considered. Again, for
determining ratios, the two quantities are to be measured in the same units. In
algebra we have discussed this in detail.
At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to —
» explain geometric ratios.
» explain the internal division of a line segment.
» verify and prove theorems related to ratios.
» verify and prove theorems related to similarity.
» explain the concepts of symmetry.
» verify line and rotational symmetry of real objects practically.

Geometric proportions
We have learnt to find the area of a triangular region. Two necessary concepts
of ratio are to be formed from this.
1. If the heights of two triangles are equal, their bases and areas are
proportional.
A D
B a CE d F
Let the bases of the triangles ABC" and DEF be BC = a, EF = d
respectively and the height in both cases be h.
1
Hence, the area of the triangle ABC = 3 x a x h, the area of the triangle DEF

=-xdxh

Therefore, the area of the triangle ABC": area of the triangle DEF

2. If the bases of two triangles are equal, their heights and areas are
proportional.
A D
B roy c EQ b F
Let the heights of the triangles ABC and DEF be AP = h, DQ = krespectively
and the base in both cases be b.

Theorem 28. A straight line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersects
the other two sides or those sides produced proportionally.
Special Nomination: In the figure, A
the straight line DE is parallel to the A
side BC of the triangle ABC. DE
intersects AB and AC (figure-1) or their D E

respectively. It is required to prove that

Step 2. The heights of AADE and ADEC are equal

pair of lines]

ie, AD: DB = AE : EC
Corollary 1. If the line parallel to BC of the triangle ABC intersects the sides

AB and AC at D and E respectively, then iD - AE and BD CE
Corollary 2. The line through the mid point of a side of a triangle parallel to
another side bisects the third line.
The proposition opposite of theorem 28 is also true. That is if a line segment
=o divides the two sides of a triangle or the line produced proportionally, it is parallel
S to the third side. Here follows the proof of the theorem.

Theorem 29. If a line segment divides the two sides or their produced sections
of a triangle proportionally, it is parallel to the third side.
Special Nomination: In the triangle n A
ABC the line segment DE divides the
two sides AB and AC or their produced
sections proportionally. That is, AD : D E
DB = AE : EC. It is required to prove B ¢
that DE and BC are parallel. B CD E
Drawing: Join B, E and C', D.
Proof:
AADE AD
Step 1. ABDE DB [Triangles with equal height]
ANADE AE
and ADEC ~ BC [Triangles with equal height]
AD AE
Step 2. But DB EC [Given]

Step 3. Therefore, ABDE — ADEC [ from (i) and (ii)]
ABDE = ADEC

Step 4. But ABDE and ADEC are on the same side of the common base DE.

So they lie between a pair of parallel lines.

BC and DE are parallel.
Theorem 30. The internal bisector of an angle of a triangle divides its opposite
side in the ratio of the sides constituting to the angle.

Proof:
Step 1. Since, DA || CE and BE is their transversal [by construction]
LAEC = ZBAD [corresponding angles]
Again, DA || CE and AC is their transversal .. ZACE = ZCAD
[corresponding angles]
Step 2. But ZBAD = ZCAD [supposition]
SL LAEC = ZACE Hence, AC' = AE [Chapter 6 Theorem 8]

Theorem 31. If any side of a triangle is divided internally, the line segment
from the point of division to the opposite vertex bisects the angle at the vertex.
Special Nomination: Let ABC be a triangle E
and the line segment AD from vertex A divides
the side BC' at D such that BD : DC = BA : n
AC. Tt is required to prove that AD bisects
ZBAC ie. ZBAD = LCAD
Drawing: Draw at C' the line segment CE
parallel to DA, so that it intersects the side BA i D re
produced at E.
Proof:
Step 1. For ABCE DA || CE [by construction]
BA: AE = BD: DC [theorem 28]
Step 2. But BD: DC = BA: AC [supposition]
S.BA: AE = BA: AC [from step 1 and step 2]
CAE = AC
Therefore, ZACE = LZAEC [base angles of isosceles triangle are equal]
Step 3. But ZAEC = ZBAD [ corresponding angles]
and ZACE = ZCAD [alternate angles]
Therefore, ZBAD = ZCAD [from step 2]

The congruence and similarity of triangles have been discussed earlier in class VIL.
In general, congruence is a special case of similarity. If two figures are congruent, i
they are similar; but two similar triangles are not always congruent. S

Equiangular Polygons: If the angles of two polygons with equal number of
sides are sequentially equal, the polygons are known as equiangular polygons.
Pr D Cc Ss R
B c [4 R A B r [4
Similar Polygons: If the vertices of two polygons with equal number of sides
can be matched in such a sequential way that
(7) The matching angles are equal and (7) The ratios of matching sides are
equal, then the two polygons are called similar polygons.
In the above figures, the rectangle ABC'D and the square PQRS are equiangular
since the number of sides in both the figures is 4 and the angles of the rectangle
are sequentially equal to the angles of the square (all right angles). Though the
similar angles of the figure are equal, the ratios of the matching sides are not the
same. Hence the figures are not similar. In case of triangles, situation like this
does not arise. As a result of matching the vertices of triangles, if one of the
conditions of similarity is true, the other condition automatically becomes true
and the triangles are similar. That is, two similar triangles are always equiangular
and two equiangular triangles are always similar.
If two triangles are equiangular and one of their matching pairs is equal, the
triangles are congruent. The ratio of the matching sides of two equiangular
triangles is a constant. Proofs of the related theorems are given below.
Theorem 32. If two triangles are equiangular, their matching sides are
proportional.

Symmetry
Symmetry is an important geometrical concept, commonly exhibited in nature
and is used almost in every field of our activity. Artists, designers, architects,
carpenters always make use of the idea of symmetry. Tree-leaves, flowers,
beehives, houses, tables, chairs -everywhere we find symmetrical designs. A
figure has line symmetry, if there is a line about which the figure may be folded
so that the two parts of the figure will coincide.

Line of symmetry of a regular polygon
A polygon is a closed figure made of several line segments. A polygon is said to be
regular if all its sides are of equal length and all its angles are equal. The triangle
is a polygon made up of the least number of line segments. An equilateral triangle
is a regular polygon of three sides. An equilateral triangle is regular because its
sides as well as angles are equal. A square is the regular polygon of four sides.

reflection. A geometrical figure has line symmetry when
one half of it is the mirror image of the other half. So, the
line of symmetry is also called the reflection symmetry.

Rotational symmetry
When an object rotates around any fixed point, its shape and size do not change.
But the different parts of the object change their position. If the new position
of the object after rotation becomes identical to the original position, we say the
object has a rotational symmetry. The wheels of a bicycle, ceiling fan, square etc.
are examples of objects having rotational symmetry. As a result of rotation the
blades of the fan looks exactly the same as the original position more than once.
The blades of a fan may rotate in the clockwise direction or in the anticlockwise
direction. The wheels of a bicycle may rotate in the clockwise direction or in the
anticlockwise direction. The rotation in the anticlockwise direction is considered
the positive direction of rotation.
This fixed point around which the object rotates is the centre of rotation. The
angle of turning during rotation is called the angle of rotation. A full-turn means
rotation by 360°; a half-turn is rotation by 180°.
In the figure below, a fan with four blades rotating by 90° is shown in different
positions. It is noted during a complete revolution in four positions (rotating
about the angle by 90°, 180°, 270° and 360°), the fan looks exactly the same. For
this reason, it is said that the rotational symmetry of the fan is order 4.

Here is one more example for rotational symmetry. Consider the intersection of
two diagonals of a square the centre of rotation. In the quarter turn about the
centre of the square, any diagonal position will be as like as the second figure. In
this way, when you complete four quarter-turns, the square reaches its original
position. It is said that a square has a rotational symmetry of order 4.

Observe also that every object occupies same position after one complete
revolution. So every geometrical object has a rotational symmetry of order 1.
For finding the rotational symmetry of an object, one needs to consider the
following matter.
1) The centre of rotation
2) The angle of rotation
3) The direction of rotation
4) The order of rotational symmetry

Line symmetry and rotational symmetry
We have seen that some geometrical shapes have only line symmetry, some have
only rotational symmetry and some have both line symmetry and rotational
symmetry. For example, the square has four lines of symmetry as well rotational
symmetry of order 4.
The circle is the most symmetrical figure, because it can be rotated around its
centre through any angle. Therefore, it has unlimited order of rotational of
symmetry. At the same time, every line through the centre forms a line of
reflection symmetry and so it has unlimited number of lines of symmetry.

We know that bounded plane figures may have different shapes. If the region is
bounded by four sides, it is known as quadrilateral. Quadrilaterals have classification
and they are also named based on their shapes and properties. Apart
from these, there are many regions bounded by more than four sides.
These are polygonal regions or simply polygons. Every closed region has a
certain measurement which is called the area of the region. For measurement of
areas usually the area of a square with sides of 1 unit of length is used as the
unit area and their areas are expressed in square units. For example, the area of
Bangladesh is 1.47 lacs square kilometers (approximately). In our day to day life
we need to know and measure areas of polygons for meeting the necessity of life.
So, it is important for the learners to have a comprehensive knowledge about
areas of polygons. Areas of polygons and related theorems and constructions are
presented here.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to

» explain the area of polygons

» verify and prove theorems related to areas.

» construct polygons and justify construction by using given data.

» construct a quadrilateral with area equal to the area of a triangle.

» construct a triangle with area equal to the area of a quadrilateral.
Area of a Plane Region
Every closed plane region has definite area. In order to measure such area, usually
the area of a square having sides of unit length is taken as the unit. For example,
the area of a square with a side of length 1 em is 1 square centimere.

the ray EF at F. Again, through C, draw the ray CG parallel to EF which

Mensuration
The length of a line, the area of a place, the volume of a solid etc. are
determined for practical purposes. In the case of measuring any such quantity,
another quantity of the same kind having some definite magnitude is taken as
unit. The ratio of the quantity measured and the unit defined in the above
process is the amount of the quantity.
tity measured
i.e. magnitude = = Quantity measured a v a
Unit quantity
In the case of a fixed unit, every measure is a number which denotes how many
times the magnitude of the unit is the magnitude of the quantity measured. For
example, the bench is 5 meter long. Here metre is a definite length which is taken
as a unit and in comparison to that the bench is 5 times in length.

Statistics
Owing to the contribution of information and data, the world has become a
global village for the rapid advancement of science and information.
Globalization has been made possible due to rapid transformation and expansion
of information and data. So, to keep the continuity of development and for
participating and contribute in globalization, it is essential for the students at
this stage to have clear knowledge about information and data. In the context,
to meet the demands of students in acquiring knowledge, information and data
have been discussed from class VI and class-wise contents have been arranged
step by step. In continuation of this, the students of this class will know and
learn cumulative frequency, frequency polygon, ogive curve in measuring of
central tendency mean, median, mode etc. in short-cut method.
At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to —

» explain cumulative frequency, frequency polygon and ogive curve.

» explain data by the frequency polygon, and ogive curve.

» explain the method of measuring of central tendency.

» explain the necessity of short-cut method in the measurement of central

tendency,

» find the mean, median and mode by the short-cut method.

» explain the diagram of frequency polygon and ogive curve.
Presentation of Data: We know that numerical information which are not
qualitative are the data of statistics. The data under investigation are the raw
materials of statistics. They are in unorganized form and it is not possible to take
necessary decision directly from the unorganized data. It is necessary to organize
and tabulate the data. And the tabulation of data is the presentation of the data.
In previous class we have learnt how to organize the data in tabulation. We know
that it is required to determine the range of data for tabulation. Then determining
the class interval and the number of classes by using tally marks, the frequency

distribution table is made. Here, the methods of making frequency distribution
table are to be re-discussed through example for convenient understanding.
Example 1. In a winter season, the temperature (in celsius) of the month of
January in the district of Srimangal is placed below. Find the frequency
distribution table of the temperature.
14°, 14°, 14°, 13°, 12°, 13°, 10°, 10°, 11°, 12°, 11°, 10°, 9°, 8°, 9°, 11°, 10°, 10°,
8°, 0°, 7°, 6°, 6°, 6°, 6°, 7°, 8°, 9°, 9°, 8°, 7°
Solution: Here the minimum and maximum numerical values of the data of
temperature are 6 and 14 respectively.
Hence the range = (14 —6) +1 =9
If the class interval is considered to be 3, the numbers of class will be 2 or 3
Considering 3 to be the class interval, if the data are arranged in 3 classes, the
frequency table will be:

‘Work: Form two groups of all the students studying in your class. Find the
frequency distribution table of the weights (in Kgs) of all the members of the
groups.
Cumulative Frequency: In Example 1 considering 3 the class interval and
determining the number of classes, the frequency distribution table has been made.
The number of classes of the mentioned data is 3. The limit of the first class is
6° — 8°. The lowest range of the class is 6° and the highest range is 8°. The
frequency of this class is 11. Similarly, The limit of the second class is 9° — 11°
and the frequency of this class is 13. Now if the frequency 11 of first class is added
to the frequency 13 of the second class, we get 24. This 24 will be the cumulative
frequency of the second class and the cumulative frequency of first class as begins
with the class will be 11. Again, if the cumulative frequency 24 of the second
class is added to the frequency of the third class, we get 24 + 7 = 31 which is the pS
cumulative frequency of the third class. Thus cumulative frequency distribution &

table is made. In the context of the above discussion, the cumulative frequency
distribution of temperature in Example 1 is as follows:

Example 2. The marks obtained in English by 40 students in an annual
examination are given below. Make a cumulative frequency table of the marks
obtained.
70, 40, 35, 60, 55, 58, 45, 60, 65, 80, 70, 46, 50, 60, 65, 70, 58, 60, 48, 70, 36, 85,
60, 50, 46, 65, 55, 61, 72, 85, 90, 68, 65, 50, 40, 56, 60, 65, 46, 76
Solution:
Range of the data = (highest numerical value — lowest numerical value) + 1 =
(90 —35)+1=55+1=56

Let the class interval be 5 then the number of classes = + = 11.2 or 12 [taking

356 Mathematics Classes IX-X
temperatures are variable. Similarly, in example 2, the secured marks used in the
data are the variables.
Discrete and Indiscrete variable: The variables used in statistics are of two
types. Such as, discrete and indiscrete vari ables. The variables whose values
are only integers, are discrete variables. The marks obtained in example 2 are
discrete variables. Similarly, only integers are used in population indicated data.
That is why, the variables of data used for population are discrete variables. A
nd the variables whose numerical values can be any real number are indiscrete
variables. Such as, in example 1, the temperature indicated data which can be
any real number. Besides, any real number can be used for the data related to
age, height, weight etc. That is why, the variables used for those are indiscrete
variables. The number between two indiscrete variables can be the value of those
variables. Some times it becomes necessary to make class interval indiscrete. To
make the class interval indiscrete, the actual higher limit of a class and the lower
limit of the next class are determined by fixing mid-point of a higher limit of any
class and the lower limit of the next class. Such as, in example 1 the actual
higher-lower limits of the first class are 8.5° and 5.5° respectively and that of the
second class are 11.5°  8.5° etc.

‘Work: Form a group of maximum 40 students of your class. Form

Diagram of Data: We have seen that the collected data under investigation
are the raw materials of the statistics. If the frequency distribution and
cumulative frequency distribution table are made with them, it becomes clear to
comprehend and to draw a conclusion. If that tabulated data are presented
through diagram, they become easier to understand as well as attractive. That
is why, presentation of statistical data in tabulation and diagram is widely and
frequently used method. In class VIII, different types of diagram in the form of
line graph and histogram have been discussed elaborately and the students have
been taught how to draw them. Here, how frequency polygon, pie-chart, ogive
curve are drawn from frequency distribution and cumulative frequency table will
be discussed.

Central Tendency: Central tendency and its measurement have been discussed

in class VII and VIII. We have seen if the data under investigation are arranged

in order of values, the data cluster round near any central value. A gain if the
disorganized data are placed in frequency distribution table, the frequency is found
to be abundant in a middle class i.e. frequency is maximum in middle class. In
fact, the tendency of data to be clustered around the central value is number
and it represents the data. The central tendency is measured by this number.

Generally, the measurement of central tendency is of three types (1) Arithmetic

means (2) Median (3) Mode :

Arithmetic Mean: We know if the sum of data is divided by the numbers of the

data, we get the arithmetic mean. But this method is complex, time consuming

and there is every possibility of committing mistake for large numbers of data. In
such cases, the data are tabulated through classification and the arithmetic mean
is determined by short-cut method.

Example 7. The frequency distribution table of the marks obtained by the

students of a class is as follows. Find the arithmetic mean of the marks.

Solution: Here class interval is given and that is why it is not possible to know
the individual marks of the students. In such case, it becomes necessary to know

the mid-value of the class.
Midovalue of the class — Class upper hl lower value
If the class mid-value is 2;(¢ = 1...k) the mid-value related table will be as
follows:

Arithmetic mean of classified data (short-cut method): The short-cut
method is easy for determining arithmetic mean of classified data. The steps to
determine mean by short-cut method are :
1. To find the mid-value of classes.
2. To take convenient approximated mean (a) from the mid-values.
3. To determine steps deviation, the difference between class mid-values and
approximate mean are divided by the class interval i.e.
Co mid value — approximate mean
steps deviation 4 = ——mM— —
class interval
4. To multiply the steps deviation by the corresponding class frequency.
5. To determine the mean of the deviation and to add this mean with 5
approximate mean to find the required mean. S

of your class and find the mean without using any formula.
2) From the above problem, deduct the heights of 9 students and then find
the median of heights (in cm.) of 40 students.
Determining Median of Classified Data: If the number of classified data is

Work: Make two groups with all the students of your class. (a) Make
a frequency distribution table of the time taken by each of you to solve a
problem, (b) find the median from the table.
Mode:
In class VIII, we have learned that the number which appears maximum times in
a data is the mode of the data. In a data, there may be one or more than one
mode. If there is no repetition of a member in a data, data will have no mode.
Now we shall discuss how to determine the mode of classified data using formula.
Determining Mode of Classified Data: Mode = L + rh Le xh, where
hit Jz

L is the lower limit of mode-class i.e. the class where the mode lies,

fi = frequency of mode-class — frequency of the class previous

[> = frequency of mode class — frequency of next class of mode class and h =class

interval.

Example 13. Following is a table.

Class interval | 31 —40 | 41 —50 | 51-60 | 61-70 | 71 —80 | 81 —90 | 91 — 100

1) What is central tendency?

2) Find mode from the above table.

3) Draw ogive curve of the given data.

Solution:

1) If the disorganized data of statistics are arranged according to the value, the
data cluster round near any central value. Moreover, abundance of data is
observed in a single class when these data are presented in some frequency
distribution table. This tendency of data to cluster around central value is
known as central tendency. .

Appendix
Some additional content related to Chapter 3, 6 and 12 of Mathematics in Class nine
is added as annexure. Because in 2025, the students studying in the nineth grade
have studied in the previous grade (seventh and eighth grade) according to the
‘National Curriculum 2022". According to the National Curriculum 2022’, the
above mentioned content was not included in the seventh and eighth grades.
Hence the above mentioned content is included for continuity of learning and
effective learning.
It should be noted that the continuous and summative evaluation will be
conducted according to the learning outcomes of grade nineth Mathematics.
Inclusion to Chapter 3
Reduction of fractions
Reduction of a fraction means to transfer the fraction to its lowest terms. For
this purpose, both the numerator and denominator are to be divided by their
common divisor or factor. If there is no common divisor or factor in between
numerator and denominator of a fraction, such fraction is said to be in its lowest
terms.

Fractions with common denominators
Fractions with common denominator is also known as the fractions with
equal denominator. In this case, the denominators of the given fractions are
to be made equal.
We consider the fractions and ZL L.C.M. of the denominators 25 and
3n -
3n is 6bn. g

L.C.M. of the two fractions = (a + 2)(a — 2)(a + 5)
Now let us express fractions with common denominators

Quadrilateral
In previous classes, we have discussed triangles and quadrilaterals. In
constructing a particular triangle, we have seen that three measures are required.
So, naturally the question arises whether four measures are enough to draw a
quadrilateral. In this chapter, we shall discuss this matter. Besides, different types
of quadrilaterals, such as parallelograms, rectangles, squares and rhombuses
have various properties. The properties of these quadrilaterals and their
constructions have also been discussed in this chapter.
At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to -
» Verify and logically prove the properties of quadrilateral.
» Construct quadrilaterals from given data.
» Find the area of quadrilaterals by the formula of triangles.
»> Construct rectangular solids.
» Find the area of surfaces of cubic and rectangular solids.
Quadrilateral
A quadrilateral is a closed figure bounded by four line B
segments. The closed region is also known as
quadrilateral. The quadrilateral has four sides. The four
line segments by which the region is bounded, are the » c
sides of the quadrilateral.
In the figure any three points of the points 4, B, C, D are not collinear. The
quadrilateral ABCD is constructed by the four line segments AB, BC, CD and DA.
The points 4, B, C and D are the vertices of the quadrilateral. Z4BC, ZBCD,
ZCDA and ZDAB are the four angles of the quadrilateral. The vertices 4 and B are
the opposite vertices of C and D respectively. The pairs of sides AB and CD, AD
and BC are sides opposite to each other. The two sides that meet at a vertex are the
adjacent sides. For example, the sides, AB and BC are the adjacent sides. The line
segments AC and BD are the diagonals of ABCD. The sum of the lengths of sides is
the perimeter of the quadrilateral. The perimeter of the quadrilateral 4BCD is equal
to the length of (4B+BC+CD+DA). We often denote quadrilaterals by the
symbol ‘7°. ~

equal square faces or surfaces each of which is a square
region.

Figure-2
Again, two mutually opposite faces are parallel. The square solid is called cube.
The intersecting line segments of each of two faces are called the edges or sides
of the cube. All the edges or sides of a cube are equal. So, the area of all faces are
equal.

according to the figure, area of the
whole face of the solid = {(ab + ab) + (bc + bc) + (ac + ac)} sq. unit
= 2(ab + bc + ac) sq. unit

(b) Cube
If the side of a cube is a unit, then area of each of the six faces of the
cube=a x a sq. unit = a? sq. unit.
Therefore, area of the whole faces of the cube = 6a? sq. unit.
Example : The length, the breadth and the height of a rectangular solid are
respectively 7.5 cm, 6 cm and 4 cm. Find the area of the entire faces of the solid.
Solution : We know, if the length, the breadth and the height of a solid are

We need to prove that ZAOC is equal to the opposite 0
Z/BOD and ZCOB is equal to the opposite ZAOD. B
Proof:
The ray OA intersects line CD at point O.
Therefore, ZAOC + ZAOD = 1 straight angle = 2 right angle. [Theorem 1]
Similarly, the ray OD intersects line AB at point O. Hence, ZAOD + ZBOD = 1
straight angle = 2 right angle. [Theorem 1]
So, ZAOC + ZAOD = ZAOD + ZBOD
Therefore, ZAOC=/BOD [Subtracting ZAOD from both sides]
Similarly, it can be shown that ZCOB = ZAOD [Proved]

of DE as point F. Since AB=DE, point B will coincide with point E.

2. Since /ZBAC=/EDF and side AB coincides with side DE, side AC will
coincide with side DF (by angle equality).

3. Since AC=DF, point C will coincide with point F (by side equality).

4. Now, since point B coincides with point E and point C coincides with
point F, side BC will completely coincide with side EF.

Connect D and G.
(1)in AEGD, EG = ED [Since EG = BA = ED, and the angles opposite the

(2) Method of Elimination

Applying by this method, we can solve the equations by following the steps

below :

(a) Multiply both the equations by two such numbers separately so that
the coefficients of one variable become equal.

(b) If the coefficients of a variable are of the same or opposite sign, subtract
or add the equations. The equation after subtraction (or addition) will
be reduced to an equation of one variable.

(c) Find the value of a variable by the method of solution of simple equation.

no (d) Put the obtained value of the variable in any one of the given equations
S and find the value of the other variable.
