Preface
The importance of formal education is diversified. The prime goal of modern education
is not to impart knowledge only but to build a prosperous nation by developing skilled
human resources. At the same time, education is the best means of developing a society
free from superstitions and adheres to science and facts. To stand as a developed nation
in the science and technology-driven world of the 21st century, we need to ensure
quality education. A well-planned education is essential for enabling our new
generation to face the challenges of the age and to motivate them with the strength of
patriotism, values, and ethics. In this context, the government is determined to ensure
education as per the demand of the age.
Education is the backbone of a nation and a curriculum provides the essence of formal
education. Again, the most important tool for implementing a curriculum is the
textbook. The National Curriculum 2012 has been adopted to achieve the goals of the
National Education Policy 2010. In light of this, the National Curriculum and Textbook
Board (NCTB) has been persistently working on developing, printing, and distributing
quality textbooks. This organization also reviews and revises the curriculum, textbook,
and assessment methods according to needs and realities.
Secondary education is a vital stage in our education system. This textbook is catered
to the age, aptitude, and endless inquisitiveness of the students at this level, as well as
to achieve the aims and objectives of the curriculum. It is believed that the book written
and meticulously edited by experienced and skilled teachers and experts will be
conducive to a joyful experience for the students. It is hoped that the book will play a
significant role in promoting creative and aesthetic spirits among students along with
subject knowledge and skills.
Physics has been integrated with the history of science since the dawn of civilization.
From engineering to today's much-discussed artificial intelligence, Physics-based
methods are heavily used everywhere. The physics for class IX and X has been written
and aligned with the basic global concepts of Physics. The theoretical concepts of
Physics are explained and graded in the light of various familiar phenomena and
literature. The practical importance of the subject has been highlighted through the
investigative activities. Necessary revisions have been made in the textbook by the
expert panel in 2024 to present the age-old tradition of physics appropriately to the
students.
It may be mentioned here that due to the changing situation in 2024 and as per the
needs the textbook has been reviewed and revised for the academic year 2025. It is
mentionable here that the last version of the textbook developed according to the
curriculum 2012 has been taken as the basis. Meticulous attention has been paid to the
textbook to make it more learner-friendly and error-free. However, any suggestions for
further improvement of this book will be appreciated.
Finally, I would like to thank all of those who have contributed to the book as writers,
editors, reviewers, illustrators and graphic designers.

When you think about science, the image of different instruments, inventions,
research laboratories etc. might appear in your mind. But the instrument,
research or laboratory are not the subject matter of science; the actual subject
matter of science is its scientific view . The greatest contribution of this civilization
has come from science and that came from the scientific view of the human
beings of the world. To explore the mysteries of science, sometimes they are
explained with logic, sometimes examined in laboratories and some other times
they are scrutinized intensively in nature. From the ancient time to modern era the
scientists are relentlessly working to advance science. The gradual development
of physics has been described in this chapter.

If we read the history of physics we will see that it is developed by the combined
efforts of both theoretical and experimental scientists. In order to carry out
research in the laboratory, we need to measure different quantities precisely.

one can measure and what type of instrument are used for measuring them.
® By the end of this chapter we will be able to-

o explain the scope and gradual development of physics.

o describe the objectives of studying physics.

o cxplain the physical quantities [with units and magnitude] and the origin of

physics.

1.1 Physics:
Physics is the most ancient branch of science. It is because scientists started
studying and practising astronomy, the most important branch of physics, before
other branches of science had flourished. Besides, being the oldest branch,
physics can said to be the most fundamental branch of science. Chemistry
flourished on the basis of physics. Biology flourished on the basis of Chemistry,
and again, many other subjects flourished on the basis of Biology.
Generally, we can say that the branch of science that tries to understand matter
and energy and the interaction between them is called physics. You must have
realized that here physics does not refer to only the visible things around us but
also the things such as molecules-atoms, electrons, protons, neutrons, quarks or
string etc. Again energy may encompass strong and weak nuclear energy apart
from our known potential energy, kinetic energy, gravitational energy or
electromagnetic energy.
1.2 Scope of physics
Since physics is the oldest and the most fundamental branch and other branches
somehow flourished on the basis of physics, it is very natural that the scope of
physics is very vast. Not only that, different technologies have flourished based
on different laws of physics and we are using these in our daily lives (there are
examples of some instruments used in medical science in the final chapter). At
present the greatest contribution behind civilization is of electronics and physics
has the greatest contribution to this technology also. Besides daily activities,
from destruction of war to space exploration, the contribution of physics is
present. Not only that, by the combination of other branches of science and
physics, newer branches have developed, for example, astrophysics consists of
astronomy and physics. In order to explain organic processes, biophysics has
been built up by the combination of biology and physics, chemical physics was
born by the combination of chemistry and physics. Use of physics in Geology
has developed Geophysics. Medical physics has flourished using physics.
Therefore the area of physics is very vast and deep as well.
For the advantage of teaching-learning we may divide physics into two principal
parts. These are:

. Classical Physics: This contains mechanics, sound, heat and thermodynamics,

d electricity and magnetism and optics.


--- Page 9 ---
4 Physics
Modern Physics: Modern Physics has been developed using Quantum
Mechanics and Theory of Relativity. These are molecular and atomic physics,
nuclear physics, solid state physics and particle physics.
We have mentioned earlier that many kinds of technologies have been
developed in the world using physics or other branches of science. Using these
technologies we have made our lives comfortable and meaningful. The
invention of some dangerous technology has endangered not only our lives but
also the existence of our earth. Sometimes unjustified and unnecessary
technology has destroyed the resources of our earth along with creating
pollution. So remember that technology is not always good, as there are good
technologis in the world, also there are bad technologis. Using your conscience,
you have to understand which technology is good or bad.
Physics was not built in a single day, it took hundreds of years to develop. The
physicists tried to explain, with the help of laws, the mysterious world around
them. Sometimes those laws were accepted, changed or rejected through
experiments. Thus, we are able to explain microscopic particle of matter to shape
of largest universe and we are learning continuously. Perhaps this learning is not
complete still now- scientists are trying to make it complete, it will be possible
to explain everything of apparently different subject with the help of a few laws
one day.
@ Do Yourself
Technology may be good or bad but knowledge can never be bad. In the light
of invention of physics give logical arguments in favour of this.

1.3 Development of physics

Modern civilization is the contribution of science. This advancement of science
has not been achieved in a day. The modern science reached its present state s

gradually following tireless labour of innumerable scientists and researchers. It
has to be remembered that, in ancient time the exchange of information was not
so easy, it was very difficult to convey the results of research to one another,
books were written by hand form and the number of such books were very few.
Courage was needed to express views against conventional faiths. There are
examples of imprisonment or even scientists being burnt to death. But the search
for knowledge was not stopped and by exploring the mysteries of nature, the
scientists have given us this modern science as a gift.
We can describe the history of physics by dividing it into different stages.
1.3.1 Initial Stage (Greek, Indian subcontinent, China and the
Contribution of Muslim Civilization)
What we understand by physics at present was introduced in the ancient times,
by the combination of astronomy, optics, dynamics geometry, and an important
branch of mathematics. The name of the Greek scientist Thales (624-586 BC)
can be mentioned specially, because he was the first to deny explanations which
were only based on religion, myth and extrasensory perception but without logic.
Thales predicted about the solar eclipse and knew about the magnetic property
of loadstone. Pythagoras (527 BC) was remarkable among the mathematicians
and scientists of that time. He had fundamental works on vibrating wire along
with geometry. Greek philosopher Democritus ( 460 BC) presented the idea first
that matter has indivisible units, called atom (This name is used by modern
physics). It was not acceptable to all since there was no chance to prove his idea
by any scientific process. The theory that everything was made of soil, water, air
and fire by the greatest philosopher and scientist of that time, Aristotle was much
more acceptable. Aristarchus (310 BC) first gave the idea of sun centered solar

6 Physics
system. His follower Seleucus proved those ideas with arguments, although
these arguments have been lost with time. Greek science and mathematics
reached its peak at the time of Archimedes (287 BC), the greatest scientist of all
times. The upward thrust of liquids is still included in the content of science. He
assisted, during the war, by setting enemy ships on fire by converging the solar
light using a spherical mirror. There was another scientist of Greek era named
Eratosthenes (276 BC), determined the radius of the earth accurately at that time.
After that, the development of science came to a stand-still for almost one
thousand and five hundred years. Only the civilizations of the Indians, Muslims
and Chinese kept practising the study of science following Greek convention. In
the Indian subcontinent Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta and Vaskar did a lot of
valuable works on mathematics and astronomy. Zero was effectively used in the
Indian subcontinent (Aryabhatta). The name of Al Khorgimi (783 BC) has to be
specially mentioned among the Muslim mathematicians and scientists. The
present name algebra has come from the book Al Zaber written by him. Ibne Al
Hayum (965 BC) is considered as the founder of optics. Al Masudi wrote an
encyclopedia of thirty parts regarding the history of nature. Everyone knows the
name of Omar Khayam as a poet. But he was a highly famous mathematician,
astronomer and philosopher. Chinese mathematicians and scientists have done a
lot of work in physics. Among them the name of Shen Kuor can be mentioned
(1031), studied magnets and mentioned the technique of finding directions by
using a compass during travel.

1.3.2 Rising Stage of Science

In the sixteenth and seventeenth century, a wonderful revolution started in the
realm of physics. It was the era of European renaissance. In 1543 Copernicus
gave the explanation of the solar centric solar system in a book. (the publisher of
the book became afraid of the priest and wrote that it is not a real explanation,
only a mathematical solution!) The theory was not made available to the people
for a long time, Galileo (1564-1642) brought it to the fore front. He introduced
the mathematical formulation. After that he introduced the scientific process to
prove the law through experiments. Sometimes Galileo is called the father of
modern science. He fell victin of the anger of the church as the founder of solar
centric solar system. He had to pass his last days in captivity. In 1687 Newton
published the three laws of mechanics and the law of gravitational force, which
provided the foundation of force and dynamics. Besider optics and other works
scientist Newton invented a new branch of mathematics called calculus along 5
with Leibniz. S

Before the eighteenth century heat was considered a mass-less liquid. In 1768
Count Rumford showed that heat is a kind of energy and mechanical energy can
be converted into heat energy. Lord Kelvin, in 1850, introduced two important
laws of thermodynamics on the basis of the research work of many other
scientists.
An extensive research started on electricity and magnets at that time. In 1778
Coulomb invented the law of force between charges. Many kinds of research
were started after the invention of the electric battery by Volta in 1800. In 1820
Oersted showed that magnets can be made by the flow of electricity. In
1831 Faraday invented just the opposite process given by Oersted. They showed
that electricity can be produced by varying the magnetic field. In 1864 Maxwell
(Figure 1.03) expressed the varying electric and magnetic fields with a single
law, the famous Maxwell equation. Here, he also showed that actually light is an
electromagnetic wave. Electricity and magnets are not different. In fact they are
the two forms of the same energy. This invention was well-timed because in
1801 Young proved the wave nature of light through experiments.
1.3.3. Introduction to Modern Physics
From the very beginning of 19th century scientists felt that many things
could not be explained with the help of existing physics. Dalton introduced
atomic theory in 1803, Thomson invented an electron within the atom, In 1911
Rutherford showed that at the center of the atom, there is the smallest nucleus and
there are positive charges in it. But it was found that the revolving electron
model around the nucleus could not be explained because, according to
electromagnetic theory, an electron should radiate its energy and fall into the
nucleus, but practically it never happens. In 1900, Max Planck introduced
quantum theory, which made it possible to explain black body radiation. Later, scientist
§ Niels Bohr used quantum theory to explain the stability of the atom. In 1924, scientist
Satyendra Nath Bose applied the concept of quantum theory to develop quantum

statistics related to radiation. For this, he is referred to as the father of quantum
statistics. In recognition of his contributions, a class of fundamental particles was
named "bosons" after him.Between 1900 and 1930, many prominent scientists,
including Heisenberg, Schrodinger, and Dirac, collectively established the quantum
theory of matter.

An imaginary medium called ether was considered as the carrier of the
electromagnetic wave. In 1887 Michelson and Morley, while trying to prove the
existence of ether, showed that actually there is no ether and the velocity of
light is equal in both stationary and moving mediums. We get this explanation
from Einstein’s theory of relativity in 1905. (Fig-1.04) The most wonderful
equation E = mc? is derived from the theory of relativity in which it is shown
that the mass of object can be converted into energy.
In 1931 Dirac hypothesised the existence of an anti particle by the combination
of quantum theory and the theory of relativity and it was discovered the following
year.

Curie (Fig:1.03) invented radium and the scientists understood that actually the "
atoms are not imperishable and on disintegrating, these atoms may emit radioactive ~~ &
radiation .

1.3.4 Contemporary Physics

Due to the invention of electronics and modern technology it is possible to make
powerful particle accelerators. Accelerating the particle with high energy, new
particles are being discovered. It is possible to arrange these particles
systematically using the Theoretical Standard Model. It is possible to explain the
structure of all the particles using a few elementary particles (and their
antiparticles) though apparently we think there are an infinite numbers of new
particles. It is not possible to explain the mass of the particles using the Standard
Model, so to explain the mass, the existence of a new particle called the Higgs
Boson was proposed. The identification of the Higgs Boson particle in the
laboratory in 2013 is treated as a great success of theoretical physics.

In 1924 Hubble showed that all galaxies of the universe are moving away from
one another, which indicates that the universe is expanding slowly. This means
that once upon a time the whole universe was concentrated at a point. Scientists
showed that fourteen billion years ago through a massive explosion called the
Big Bang the universe was created and it is continuing to expand. Very recently
scientists showed that this expansion will never stop and every part of the
universe will keep moving away from one another. Besides, the physicist have
shown that they can explain only 4% of visible planets, stars, and galaxies of the
universe, the concept of the mysterious dark matter and dark energy has to be
accepted to explain the rest of the universe. The scientists are continuing their
research in this field.

Semiconductors are created from the research of solid state physics resulting in
present electronics which laid the foundation of modern civilization.

1.3.5 Contributions of Jagadish Chandra Bose

Acharya Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose (Fig: 14.01) was a renowned physicist, as
well as a successful biologist. He was the first internationally recognized
scientist of this subcontinent. The forefathers of Jagadishchandra Bose lived at
the village of Rarikhal of Bikrampur in Dhaka district. He was born in 1858 in
Mymensingh. His father, Bhagaban Chandra Bose, was a deputy
magistrate of Faridpur district.

His education started in a rural school of Faridpur. Later he completed his studies
from Hare School and Saint Xavier school and college in Kolkata. After passing
his B.A. in 1880, he went to England, and from 1880-1884 he completed his
honors with BA in Physics from Cambridge University, and then acquired B.Sc.

degree from London University. Returning to his motherland in 1885, he became
a professor of physics in Presidency College. In that time there was not enough
scopes for research in that college, but he continued his research anyway.
He was always busy during the day. So, he carried on his research at night.
He conducted a lot of research on how to send radio signals without electric
wires. In 1895, for the first time he sent a wireless radio signal to distant
places and demonstrated this publicly. He has great contributions in microwave
research; he was the first to reduce the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave
to the order of millimeter (nearly 5 mm). po
Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose used rE a EB \

it, he opened it for all.
In later years, Jagadish Chandra Bose
discovered many important aspects of plant Figure 1.04(a) Acharya Sir Jagadish

physiology. Among those, the invention of the Cresco graph to record the growth
of plants, detecting very minor movements, and matters of responding to various
stimuli are worth mentioning. Earlier it was assumed that response to stimuli
was a chemical process. He showed that it was actually electrical in nature.
In 1917 he established the Bose Biggan Mandir in Kolkata for research on plant
physiology. The writings of Jagadish Chandra Bose in bengali were compiled in
a book named ‘Obyakto’. A significant book of his is ‘Response in the living and
nonliving’. On 23 November 1937, scholar Jagadish Chandra Bose breathed his
last.
1.4 Objectives of Physics
Already you know that physics is that branch of science which explains the
change of position of an object with time in the presence of energy and force.
Like any other science the main objective of physics is to learn, the arena of
knowing in physics is very large. The objectives of physics are to unfold the
mysteries of both small atoms and the vast universe. For understanding easily —
we can divide the objectives of physics into three parts: h


--- Page 16 ---
Physical Quantities and Their Measurements 11
1.4.1 Unfold the Mystery of Nature
In ancient times in China, a piece of lodestone was seen to attract another by an
invisible force. This special property of this special type of matter was called
magnetism. Similarly in ancient Greece, when a substance called amber was
rubbed with wool, they would attract each other with an invisible force. This
special type of property is called electricity. Many research were conducted on it
in the eighteenth century and the scientists discovered that, this is actually two
different forms of the same force and this force is called an electromagnetic
force. After the invention of radioactivity while explaining a special radiation
called beta ray, a new type of force called weak nuclear force was discovered.
Later, the physicists showed that electrometric force and weak nuclear force are
the different forms of the same force. Their combination is called the electro
weak force. The physicists argue that two other forces in nature called
gravitational force and nuclear force will be brought under the same law in the
future.
Physics is unveiling the mystery of nature one after another. Similarly we can
say that an object consists of molecules, later on we see that the molecules
consist of atoms of elements. Despite the atoms being charge neutral, there is a
positive charged nucleus at the center and surrounding it, electrons are revolving.
Though an electron is an elementary particle, it is seen that the nucleus consists
of protons and neutrons. It is seen that neutrons and protons also consist of
elementary particles called quarks. At present the research topic is whether
electrons and quarks are made of strings.
1.4.2 To Know the Laws of Nature
From time immemorial we know that if something is released from above, it falls
downward and seeing this we can guess that the earth attracts everything towards
its center. If physics stops after pronouncing only the existence of gravitation,
this is not enough at all. The knowledge will not be appropriate until we precisely
know the force by which an object of a definite mass attracts another object of
another definite mass and how the force varies with the distance between them.
Newton explained this law of nature properly with the help of the law of
gravitation. The laws of nature can be used in many other places. So, the motion
of a falling body is explained with the help of gravitation, similarly the rotation
of the earth round the sun can also be explained. To know the laws of nature
«properly the scientists analysed them with argumentative discussions, while also
& conducting experiments in the laboratory. Behind the wonderful success of


--- Page 17 ---
12 Physics
physics, both theoretical and experimental research have been conducted. The
main objectives of physics is to find out the laws of nature by carrying out
research in these two different fields.
1.4.3 Development of Technology Using the Laws of Nature
From the theory of relativity Einstein deduced the law £ = mc? and showed that
mass can be converted into energy. In 1938, by breaking a nucleus Otto Hann
and Fritz Strassmann showed that the amount of mass reduced, is converted to
energy.
Using this formula the nuclear bomb was made and dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki in the Second World War and millions of people were killed within a
second. Not only deadly weapons can be made but also it is possible to use for
the good of mankind. Using this formula, nuclear power plants are made and
also in Rooppur of our country a nuclear power planty is being made.
Solid state physics is a branch of physics where semiconductors are studied.
Mixing some special elements with semiconductors, transistors are made. With
the help of this technology great development of electronics has occurred and
this has made a major contribution to the present civilization.
In this way we can show that physics has a small or large contribution in every
field of technology. Contributions of physics only in medical science are discussed in
the last chapter of this book.

1.5 Physical Quantities and Their Measurements
We all know that water becomes ice when it is cooled; it becomes vapor when it
is heated. Peoples have been observing it from the very ancient times. This
knowledge alone cannot be science completely, unless we can say at what
condition and at what temperature water becomes ice after freezing or raising
the temperature at what condition and at what temperature does it start to boil
and becomes vapors. This means, in order to be science, everything has to be
measured. The most important point of science is to be able to explain
everything accurately after measuring them.
Table 1.01: Seven physical quantities in SI unit
| mme | seond | 5
Electric current
In this universe anything we can measure is called a quantity. In this physical
world there are innumerable quantities which can be measured. For example, we
can name, length, breadth, volume, weight, temperature, colour, rigidity,
position, velocity, internal material, electrical conductivity, non-conductivity,
elasticity, heat conductivity, non-conductivity, density, specific heat, pressure,
melting point, etc, and we cannot finish this list. In brief, in the physical world
the quantities are endless. You may think that to measure these infinite number
of quantities, we have to prepare the definitions and units for these infinite
number of quantities! Actually that is not true, you will be surprised hearing that
(and definitely be happy) if we can fix seven units of seven quantities, we will
be able to calculate everything using these seven units. These seven quantities
are called fundamental quantities. When we express other quantity using these
«fundamental quantities that is called a derived quantity. The fundamental
& quantities are length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, amount of

substance and luminous intensity. These internationally recognized seven units
of seven fundamental quantities are called SI units, (SI came from the France
language term ‘System International d’Units) and these are shown in Table
1.01. Table 1.02 shows some very big to very small quantities of distance, mass
and time.

1.5.1 Units of Measurement
Among these units second, meter and candela are defined before by some
constants.
From May 2019 kilogram, kelvin, mole and ampere are also defined by some
constant of Physics. Now it is possible to measure all units very accurately using
these constant in any laboratory in the world.
Magnitude of fundamental constants those are essential to measure these seven
units are specified forever. The magnitude of seven constants are shown in the

Mole (Mol): Amount of substance that contains 6.02214076x10% particles

(Avogadro’s number) is called one mole.

Kelvin (K): Amount of change of temperature with the change of

1.380649x10 joule heat is called one kelvin.

Candela (cd): One candela is defined as the amount of 1/683 watt luminous

intensity which is emitted by a source of light vibrating 540x10" cycle per

said that:

o The distance from the feet to the stomach of a person of normal height is
nearly one meter.

o The water contained in one liter bottle or the water kept in four glasses have
a mass of nearly one kg.

e The time required to say three words ‘one thousand one’ is approximately
one second.

o If three mobile phones are charging at the same time, one ampere electric
current is used. (a mobile is charged at nearly 5 V. So, current consumption
will be Swatt. If lights, fans, refrigerators of a residence run at 220 V and one
ampere current is used, the power consumption will be 220 watt!)

e Ifwe can feel the fever of anyone by hand, it can be said that his temperature
has increased by one Kelvin.

o Itis difficult to understand a mole, we can say a a large spoon filled with water
contains one mole of water molecules. In one cup water, there are ten moles.

eo The light coming from a single candle can be said one candela.

You see that none of them are perfect measurements, but easy to realize. If you

are habituated with this measurement, when in future you will calculate

anything, then you will have a sense of proportion about it.

1.5.2 Prefix

To study science or physics we have to measure different things. Sometimes we

need to measure the length of a galaxy (6x10* m), or sometimes we have to

measure the radius of the nucleus (1x10"* m). To measure this huge difference
in the distance it is not wise to use the same type of numbers. So internationally
some SI prefixes have been made. Due to this multiplier we will be able to
express a large or small number by a small prefix. These prefixes are shown in

Table 1.05. In our daily life we always use these prefixes. To express distance

we say 1 kilometer instead of 1000 meter. We say 10 milliliter instead of one

hundredth of a liter to express volume of water.

1.5.3 Dimension
We already know that though there is an infinite number of quantities around
us, we can measure them with the help of seven units only. We have to know, in
which units a quantity can be expressed. Often we also need to know how this
quantity is formed with which fundamental quantities (length L, time 7, mass M
etc.). The power of different fundamental quantities in a quantity is called its
dimension. For example, we will see next that force is the product of mass and
acceleration. Again, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time. And
velocity is the rate of change of position with time.
Therefore,
. . . i L —
dimensions of velocity: [221 | -=LT?!
time T
. . . [distance L 2
dimensions of acceleration: ———|= — = LT
time T?
In this book, when we will speak about a new quantity, we will try to mention
the dimension of it at the same time. You will see that, this always will help you
to understand the quantity, in a different way. To indicate the dimensions of a
quantity in this book, it will be shown within third brackets. For example, force
F is expressed as [F]= MLT.

1.5.4 Scientific symbols and notations

The following methods are followed to write the symbol of units:

1. To express the value of a quantity, first we write a number, leave a
space after it and then write the symbol of the unit. For example, 2.21
kg, 7.3 x 102 m? or 22 K. The percentage (%) sign also follows the same rule.
However no space is left after a number to write degrees (°) minutes (") and seconds (*").

2. Derived unit produced by multiplication is written using a space between
two units, e.g. 2.35 Nm

3. Derived unit produced by division is expressed as negative power or slash
(e.g. ms~! or m/s)

4. No punctuation mark or period is used with the symbols, as they are
mathematical expressions but not the abbreviated form of anything.

5. The symbol of unit is written in straight font, for example, m for metre, s
for second etc. But the symbol of quantities are written in italic or curved
font, for example, m for mass, v for velocity etc.

6. The symbols of units are written in small letters, for example, cm, s, mol etc.
But capital letters are used for those units which are taken from the name of scientists
(N for Newton). If there are many letters in the unit then the first letter will be
capital only (the unit from the name of Pascal is Pa).

7. The prefix (k, G, M) of unit will be attached with the unit (m, W, Hz) with
no space. For example, km, GW, MHz.

8. Prefixes more than kilo (10%) will be in capital letters (M, G, T).

9. The symbols of units will never be in plural from (e.g. not 25 kgs, always 25 kg).

10. We have to try to write any number or compound unit in a single line. A line .

break can be given between a number and a unit if it is really necessary. g

1.6 Measuring Instruments
Once it was very difficult to measure different quantities of physics accurately.
The job has become much easier due to electronics based instruments. For the
physics that we will try to learn in this book, knowing how to measure distance,
mass, time, temperature, electric current and voltage will be enough. Let us
discuss what type of instruments we will use to measure these:
1.6.1 Scale or Ruler
A Meter scale is used to measure small lengths and definitely you may have seen
it. Since this is 100 cm or I m long, it is called a meter scale. Since in many places
inch-foot is familiar still now (USA is an example!) inch is marked very often
on the other side of a meter scale. One inch equals 2.54 cm.
We can measure up to the smallest division on a scale. A meter scale is generally
divided up to millimeter, so using a meter scale we can measure the length of
anything up to millimeter. Therefore, if we say the length of anything is 0.364 m,
this means the length of this is 36 centimeter and 4 millimeter. Using a meter
scale it is not possible to measure lengths smaller than this - that is, generally we
can never say the length of a body is 0.3643 m. But from time to time, for
microscopic purposes we have to measure the smallest length of objects of this
type, which can be performed by using an interesting scale called vernier scale.
Slide calipersor vernier calipers
Let us consider that the length of an object comes in between
4 and 5 millimeter marking i.e. the length of the object is greater than 4 mm and
less than 5 mm. We can use the veriner scale to find how much fraction is greater
than 4 mm. This scale is attached to the main scale and can be moved forward
and backward (Figure 1.05). In the example shown in the figure the length of 9
mm of main scale is divided into 10 divisions on the vernier scale. Therefore every
division of the vernier scale equals = mm, i.e. less than a millimeter by =
millimeter. If the initial mark of the vernier scale coincides with any mark of the
millimeter scale, then the next mark of the vernier scale will keep a separation of
= mm from the actual millimeter mark, and the next will keep a separation of E
S mm, third one will keep a separation of = mm and so on.


--- Page 25 ---
20 Physics
Therefore no mark of the vernier scale will coincide with the millimeter mark of
the main scale, finally the 10" mark will coincide again with the ninth millimeter
mark of the main scale.

Vernier scale ~g
oT
Main scale Fd
Figure 1.05: Main scale and movable vernier scale
If we keep the vernier scale in such a way that it does not start from a millimeter
mark rather it starts with a slight Ces mm) displacement (Figure 1.06) then the
number of = mm displacements by which it has moved will be the mark
of the vernier scale coinciding with the millimeter mark of the main scale! Therefore,
it is very easy to measure a length using a vernier scale. First of all, we have to know
the difference between one division of vernier scale and one division of the main
scale- this is called the vernier constant-- in brief VC. This can be calculated if we
divide the length of the smallest division (1 mm) of the main scale by the total
number of divisions of the vernier scale (in the figure 1.05 and 1.06 it is 10). In
our example, the value of this :
1mm
VC =——= 0.1mm = 0.0001 m
10

To measure a length, we have to look at the vernier scale after measuring up to
the last millimeter mark. The mark of the vernier scale that coincides exactly
with any millimeter mark of the main scale is then found, and then that number
is multiplied by the vernier constant. We will get the actual length by adding this
amount with the length measured by the main scale. According to our procedure
the length shown on the last scale of Figure 1.06 is 1.03 cm or 0.013 m. This
instrument consisting of a 'main scale’ and a 'vernier scale’ is called a Slide — &
calipers or vernier calipers a

Figure 1.06: Vernier scale displaced by one, two and three divisions
Instead of the vernier scale we can use a special type of scale called a screw
gauge to measure lengths. In a screw gauge when the screw (Figure 1.07)
rotates, the scale moves forwards or backwards, the threads of the screw are kept
very fine. After a complete rotation of the screw, the screw with the attached
scale may advanced by Imm. This displacement of the screw is called the pitch of
the screw. The circular part of the instrument, by the rotation of which the screw
moves forwards or backwards is divided into 100 equal parts. For the rotation of
only one division of the circular scale, the screw advances by = of the pitch.
Therefore, with this scale up to = mm = 0.01 mm of length measurement is
possible. This is called the least count of the screw gauge.
Figure 1.07: A slide calipers with vernier scale and a screw gauge
.. Now-a-days instead of the vernier scale, attached dials or digital slide calipers
£ are available by which lengths can be measured accurately.

1.6.2 Balance
Mass cannot be measured directly, so mass is
generally determined by measuring the weight.
‘When we say the weight of an object is 1 gm or 1
kg, then actually we mean that the mass of the WIE I
object is 1 gm or 1 kg. In earlier times to measure - 2%
the mass of an object, a balance was used, there h— —c/
the mass of the object was compared with the E tl
definite mass of a known weight. Now-a-days the Er
use of electronic balance (figure 1.08) has
increased a lot. If we keep the body on the Figure 1.08: Digital weigh
balance then the sensors of the balance can machine
determine the weight very precisely.
- : 1.6.3 Stop Watch
% Stop watches are used to measure time interval
Fp . r (figure 1.09). Once accurate stop watches were
7 very precious things. Now-a-days very accurate
i / stop watches are available in the mobile phone
at low prices due to the advancement of
< electronics. In a stop watch, time measurement
is started at any instant of time, and by stopping
the measurement of time after a definite
Figure 1.09: Stop watch interval, the elapsed time can be determined. An
interesting matter is that the stop watch can
measure the time very accurately, but we can never start or stop it with our
hands with the same accuracy.
@ Do Yourself
There is less probability for all of you to possess slide calipers
but if you want, you can make a slide calipers to carry on your work. Make a
photocopy of figure 1.10. Cut the part of the main scale and the vernier scale
and then put it together after folding as shown in the figure following the
steps (1,2, 3, ...... accordingly). Now you can measure any length accurately.
The slide calipers is also graduated in inch. So to get the length in centimeter
we need to multiply it with 2.54. 5

Objective: To find out the volume of a match box or any other object by’
measuring its length, breadth and height using a slide calipers. If you have
no slide calipers with you, you can make a slide calipers as shown in figure
1.10.
1. To measure the length of an object by slide calipers we need to place it
between the jaws of the slide calipers. The jaws need to touch the object
from both the sides.
2. Now observe carefully the mark of the main scale that the zero marking
of vernier scale has just crossed. Mark of the main scale that the. That will
be the main scale reading M. Notice that, the mark which is very close to the
main scale, is not the reading of main scale, the mark that has just crossed
the main scale fully is the main scale reading.
3. At this position find out which mark of the vernier scale coincides with
any mark of the main scale, this is the vernier coincidence.
Measure the length of the object several times and put it in the table.
In the same way measure the breadth and height of the object.

L17Errorand Accuracy ~~ 000000000000
Error is a negative word and if the word "error in measurement" used, we think
that the person who is doing the measurement is not performing his duties
properly and an error has occurred! But this is not the case. Sometimes error
may occur due to the person who is doing the measurement for his negligence,
but we have to know that the instrument with which we measure is not error free.
Therefore, there is a limit of how much accurately we can measure, i.e. it is very
natural to have errors in measurement. But there is a need to mearuse to what
extent a measusement is accurate . The reliability of a result will be increased if
we can inform how accurate the result is when we publish the result of an
experiment. You can report the measurement of the accuracy of your
experiment if you know some conventional rules for finding the accuracy of an
experiment.
Suppose, you are measuring the length of an object by a scale. How accurately
you will measure the length of the object depends on how finely your scale is
graduated. If the scale is graduated in 1 cm intervals then you will express your
result for length in some definite number of cm. But the real length of the object
is not exactly equal to this mentioned number of cm but perhaps very close to it,
so there is a possibility of uncertainty in your measured length. That is why, we
add that amount of uncertainty with the measured result. Therefore, if we see the
length is close to 4 cm, we will say the length of the object is:
(4.0 £0.5)cm

Therefore the length of the object may have any value within 3.5 cm to 4.5 cm.

Question: What is the length of the object
shown in Figure 1.11? —_— =
Answer: he length of the object is 7+0.5

26 Physics
Now we can discuss how accuracy can be measured. The measurement of
accuracy is the absolute error. Observing the name we understand that this is the
difference of the measured value with respect to the actual value. You can
definitely understand that when we measure anything we don’t know the actual
value. So, instead of absolute error we use the most probable error. Therefore in
our previous example the absolute error is

|£0.5 mm| = 0.5 mm

‘We can consider the relative error after the absolute error. Let us consider that an
error of 0.5 mm has occurred while measuning length. If the length of the object
is 1 mm then this error is very serious, but if the length is 1 m then the
measurement is accurate enough. The concept of relative error has been
introduced to give a better understanding.
Therefore, . Absolute error

Relative error = —————

Measured value

So in our previous example:

Relative error: 0.5 mm/ 7 mm = 0.071

In percentage this is: 0.071 x 100 =7.1 %
Question: Suppose you have got 10 cm by measuring the length of a square
shaped book. Suppose the relative error in the measurement is 10%. What is the
relative error in its area?
Answer:
Measured area of the object =10 cm*10 cm=100 cm?
Since the relative error of the object is 10%, hence if its length is measured, the
minimum length will be 9 cm and maximum length will be 11 cm.
~ The minimum area = 9 cm x 9 cm = 81 cm?
and the maximum area = 11cm x 11cm = 121 cm?
Therefore the absolute error:

1100 cm? — 81 cm?| = 19 cm?m?
or, [121 cm? —100 cm?| =21 ¢

Since the values are not equal, we consider the larger one i.e. the absolute
error is 21 cm? sg


--- Page 32 ---
Physical Quantities and Their Measurements 27
Therefore, the relative error = 21 cm? /100 cm? = 0.21
In percentage, 0.21 x 100 = 21%
If the error in the measurement of the length is 10%, then in the case of area
it will be approximately double. Similarly you can show that in the case
of volume measurements the error will be three times!
Question: You have measured a box by a ruler which is graduated only in cm.
You have got the length, breadth and height of the box as 10 cm, 5 cm and 4 cm
respectively. What is the percentage of error in your measurements?
Answer: Since your ruler is graduated only in cm, so your error is + 0.5 cm.
Therefore the error in your measurements:
Length: 10 + 0.5 cm
Breadth: 54 0.5 cm
Height: 4 + 0.5 cm
Your measured volume: 10 cm x 5 cm X 4 cm = 200 cm?
Probable smallest volume:
(10 — 0.5) cm x (5 — 0.5) cm x (4 — 0.5) cm = 149.625 cm*®
Probable largest volume:
(10 + 0.5) cm X (5 + 0.5) cm x (4 + 0.5) cm = 259.875 cm?
Therefore the volume,
149.625 cm® < V < 259.875 cm?

Absolute error:
From 149.625 cm? to 200 cm® is 200 cm® — 149.625 cm® = 50.375 cm®
From 200 cm® to 259.875 cm’ is 259.875 cm® — 200 cm® = 59.875 cm®
Considering the largest value we have the absolute error 59.875 cm*®
Relative error: 59.875 cm®/200 cm® x 100 = 29.9375% = 30%

There are many kinds of motions around us. When a person rides a cycle, it's a
kind of motion. When a car moves, that is another kind of motion. When a plane
flies, it is also a motion. When the earth revolves round the sun, it is also a
motion. When a hanging bulb oscillates, it is a kind of motion. When a bullet
ejects from a rifle, it's a motion also. Apparently it seems that all these several
types of motions are of different types. But you will be surprised and happy to
know that all these motions can be explained by a few number of quantities. In
this chapter those quantities, their units, dimensions and the relationship among
them will be discussed.

Motion 33
2.1 Rest and Motion

When an object does not change its position with respect to time, then it
is at rest. And when an object changes it position with time, then it is in motion.
Now we need to explain the term 'position' properly. In our daily conversation
we use the word 'position’ in different ways, but in physics the word "position
has a definite meaning. If you are asked, what is the position of your school and
if your answer is 'Jhiltuli', your answer is correct but the position of your school
remains unknown. If you reply, your school is 1 kilometer from the gate of your
residence; the position of your school is still unknown. Though the position of
the gate of your residence is known to us, yet we cannot tell exactly in which
direction the school is situated at a distance of 1 kilometer from the gate. But if
you say the school is situated 1 kilometer east from the gate of your residence,
only then we will know the exact position of your school. That is to know the
position of the school; we have to know both the distance and the direction
definitely. Not only this, this distance and direction has to be specified from the
position of a reference point. In the case of your school the gate of your
residence was the reference point or origin. Instead of your residence gate, the
reference point might be a bus stop or a shopping mall. Then definitely both the
position and the direction would have different values; but we can specify
certainly the position with respect to the new reference point. That is, to specify
the position of any object, it has to be mentioned with respect to a reference
point. This reference point is not an absolute one; we can conveniently choose
any point as reference point or origin.

Now the question is, to specify the position of an object, is it necessary for the
reference point or origin to be a static point? Let us think; in front of you a person
is sitting still on a chair. If we consider the chair as the reference point or origin,
we can firmly say, the position of your friend is not changing.

But if it happens that actually you are sitting in a moving train, what will it then be?
A man outside of the train standing on the station will say, you and your friend
are both in motion, nobody is at rest. Then whose statement is true? Your
statement or of the man standing in the station? In fact, both are correct! The
reason is- if the reference point or the origin moves at a uniform velocity, then
we cannot tell firmly whether the reference point is moving at a uniform velocity
or actually it is at rest and all other things are moving at uniform velocity in the

opposite direction. Therefore, we can say, if an object changes its position with
respect to an origin, then the object is in motion with respect to that origin. It is
not our headache whether the origin is at rest or moving at uniform velocity. This
is not important since every motion is relative.

Not only this, if we want to search out an absolute rest reference point, we will
be in trouble. If we consider anything on the surface of the earth as origin, one
can object, as earth is not stationary rather it is rotating about its own axis, so
everything on its surface is also rotating. Alternatively we can say, the center of
the earth is the origin. Then someone else can come up with the objection that
the centre of the earth is not stationary, it revolves round the sun. Then we can
say more intelligently, the centre of the sun must be the origin! Then another
person can confidently say that the sun is also not stationary it is also revolving
around the centre of our galaxy. Surely you are feeling that no one can dare to
say, the centre of our galaxy is the origin! Who can say that the galaxy and the
universe are stationary? Not only this, if the centre of the galaxy is considered as
the origin to describe any position on the surface, do you realize the extent of
complexities that may arise?

In fact, we don’t need such type of complexities; for our purpose, we can
consider any point as the origin, which seems stationary to us. In this case we
have to mention all the measurements are done with respect to this origin. In this
way scientists have done all the measurements starting from the nucleus of an
atom to the satellites launched in space, with no problems what so ever!

2.2 Different Types of Motion

We see various types of motions around us, vibrations, rotations and separations
— all these are the examples of different kinds of motions. Probable motions are
unlimited, but if we wish, we can talk about some important types of motion
separately.

Linear motion

It is an example of the easiest type of motion. If anything moves along a straight
line then its motion is a called linear motion. If an object is pushed off ona
plane surface then it moves along a straight line. If a ball is allowed to fall from
a height, it will fall straight downwards, so it is also a linear motion. §


--- Page 40 ---
Motion 35

Circular Motion

‘When a body rotates about a particular point or a line, keeping the distance of

the particles of the body unchanged, it is called circular motion. Though the

motion of electric fans, the hands of clocks etc. Are examples of circular motion,

a wonderful example of circular motion is the moon in the sky. The moon is not

tied by to the earth although it is revolving around the earth, neither is it falling

on to the earth's surface.

Translational motion

If an object moves in such a way that all the particles of the object travel the

same distance, at the same time, in the same direction then its motion is called

translational motion. Sometimes we see many examples of this type in our

surroundings. When something moves in a straight path then its example is very

common. If we do not consider the circular motion of the wheel of a car then

straight advancement of the car is an example of translational motion. At this

time every point of the car will travel the same distance, in equal time, in the

same direction.

Not rr motion dhe 3 motion
Figure 2.01: Example of translational motion

There is no obligation that the translational motion will be straight. But the

example of translational motion is not easily available in the case of a curved

path. Figure 2.01 shows how a plane has to move for every point of the plane

travelling equal distances in the same direction. The figure also shows why the

example of translational motion on a curved path is so rare.

Periodic Motion

If the motion of a moving object passes repeatedly through a definite point in

the same direction in the same manner in a definite interval of time, then this motion

is called a periodic motion. The time interval over which this repetition occurs
& is called the period of the motion. In a periodic motion, a moving particle
5 traverses each point in its path with the same speed after each period.


--- Page 41 ---
36 Physics
The vibrational motion of our heart is periodic, since it vibrates in the same
direction in the same manner after a definite interval of time. The periodic
motion may be circular (motion of the blades of a fan), hyperbolic ( orbit of
Haley's Comet around the sun) or linear ( oscillatory motion of an object hanging
from a spring).

Figure 2.02 : Example of simple harmonic motion

Simple Harmonic Motion
Simple harmonic motion is a special type of periodic motion. In case of
oscillatory motion the object oscillates on both sides of a definite point. This
specific point is called the equilibrium point. At the extreme ends of its path, the
particle's velocity is zero. As the particle moves from one end toward the equi-
librium point, its velocity gradually increases, reaching a maximum at the equi-
librium point. As it continues toward the opposite end, its velocity decreases
gradually untilitagain becomes zero. The particle then reverses direction, moving
back in the same manner until it reaches the original end and briefly stops. This
entire process takes one period. This pattern of the motion gets repeated
There are so many examples of oscillatory motion around us. The motion of an
object hanging from a spring is an example of oscillatory motion. The
oscillatory baby on a swing (Figure 2.02) or the pendulum of a clock are the
examples of oscillatory motion. When we speak, the air molecules carry the
sound forward by this type of motion.

So far we have discussed some special types of motion but the causes of these
motions have not been mentioned anywhere. The major success of physics is
that not only can it find the causes of the different types of motion of objects but
it can also explain the motion very clearly. -
Can you guess the cause of the motion? S

vector quantities.
Besides temperature examples of scalar are time, length and mass. Because they
can be expressed by a single number only. Besides position you will find the
other examples of vectors are velocity and force. You will be introduced with
velocity and force in the next chapter. Because to express these quantities,
direction is to be mentioned along with its magnitude.
To differentiate vector quantities from scalar quantities they are written in bold
font (e.g. x, y or A, B). In books or in computer printing it is easy to write
anything in bold form. But when anyone writes on a paper then to express
anything as vector, a small arrow is used over it (%,¥ or A,B).
In this book the physics you will be taught will not involve application of
vectors. At best you will be reminded which one is scalar and which one is a

2.4 Distance and Displacement

We are quite familiar with the word ‘distance’ but we do not use the word
‘displacement’ in our daily life. We want to understand the relation between the
two words- distance and displacement with the help of an example. A curved
path is shown in figure 2.04. The distance travelled with respect to the point A
is denoted by the number 1, 2, 3 in kilometer.

Let us consider you are at point A (i.e.

your position is point A). Now you have = rE

meant. This can be expressed as AB as well.

In the figure the displacement is shown by a straight line from point A to point
B with an arrowhead. In this figure the magnitude of the displacement is 3 km
and the direction of the arrow is in the direction of the displacement. Therefore
displacement is a vector quantity; it has both magnitude and direction.

If going two kilometers more by a cycle you cross a six kilometer path total and
reach point C, then your displacement will be the straight line AC with an
arrow, whose magnitude is 1.5 kilometer and the direction of the arrow is along
your displacement. Though you covered more distance along the curved path
but your displacement is still small. Therefore the more distance you cover, the
more will be the displacement is not true. The difference between the initial and
final position is the displacement.

Starting from the point A, the distance towards point B is 4 km along the
curved path, similarly the distance between point B and point Ais 4 km ie.
both are equal. But notice that the displacement from A to B and the §


--- Page 44 ---
Motion 39
displacement from B to A are not equal. One is negative of the other. In vector
form we can write, _ _
AB = —BA
Distance or displacement, both have the dimension of length.
[Displacement] = L (vector)
[Distance]= L (scalar)
2.5 Speed and Velocity
Roughly we know what is meant by velocity. The measurement of how fast a
body is moving is called the velocity. In physics, velocity has a definite
meaning and in addition to velocity we use another quantity named speed. If we
have understood the two terms distance and displacement properly, then we will
be able to understand two terms speed and velocity very easily.
Speed is the rate of change of distance with respect to time. Therefore, if you
have covered 100 m distance in 20 second, your speed will be;
100 m
VE 5m/s
The dimension of speed [vy] = 17-1
Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. Therefore, if
the change of your position along a certain direction is 50 m in 20 second, then
magnitude of your velocity will be;
_ 50m _ 25 m/
V=o0s 0m
And that certain direction is the direction of velocity.
As velocity is a vector quantity, we will have to fix its direction.
The dimension of velocity [v] = LT™*
. Here, one thing has to be noticed. If we consider only linear motion, then there
Sis no difference between velocity and speed, the magnitude of velocity is the


--- Page 45 ---
40 Physics
speed. To understand the internal relationship between speed and velocity, some
examples discussed:
To explain distance and displacement we considered a curved path in figure 2.04
and showed different positions in that path. To have an understanding about
speed and velocity, we can consider the same example. But now we have to tell
how much time you have taken for going from one position to another. Suppose
you have taken 20 minutes for coming from position A to B by cycle. Then your
average speed will be:
Average speed = distance travelled/time
Therefore, __ tm 4x1000m_

Y= 20 minutes © 20x 60s oS
Notice that, we have used the word average speed instead of the word
speed. Because, while you are riding the cycle, sometimes you rode fast and
sometimes you rode slow. So we cannot talk about the ‘instantaneous’ speed,
rather we can talk about the average speed in the time interval.
Let us try to determine velocity now. Like speed, we cannot calculate
instantaneous velocity. In this time interval, you rode the cycle at different
velocities. The velocity has changed due to the motion being fast or slow. Again
the velocity has changed due to the change of direction. Considering these
changes, the magnitude of the average velocity will be:
Average velocity = displacement/time
Magnitude of average velocity = Magnitude of displacement/time

3 km 3x 1000 m

Therefore, = = =

V= ZO minutes © 20x 605 20 M/S
In this example you have noticed that the value of the average velocity is less
than that of the average speed. If the path was straight rather than curved, then
the magnitude of the average velocity would be equal to the magnitude of the
average speed.

3


--- Page 46 ---
Motion 41
In our example, if you rode your cycle always at the same speed then we say
your speed is uniform speed. When anything moves with uniform speed then its
instantaneous speed and average speed will be the same.

Notice that, since the path is curved, if you go through this path your direction is
changing continuously. Therefore you can move with uniform speed through
this path but you cannot go with uniform velocity. If anything moves in a linear
motion along a straight line, only then uniform velocity or constant velocity is
possible.

0) Example

Question: Let us consider another example to understand the relation between
velocity and speed more clearly. Tie a small piece of stone with a string and
rotate it around head (figure 2.05). Does the stone move with uniform
velocity or with uniform speed? Or with uniform speed and uniform velocity?

uniform.

Question: If the stone is suddenly released, will it move with uniform velocity
and with uniform speed?

Answer: If the stone is released suddenly, it will move straight with uniform
velocity and uniform speed. It will continue to move with uniform velocity and
uniform speed if there is no air friction or gravitational force etc.

2.6 Acceleration and Deceleration or Retardation
‘When an object moves with uniform velocity it has no acceleration. If there is a
change of velocity, then there is an acceleration. More clearly, we can say, the
rate of change of velocity with time is acceleration.
Since velocity has both magnitude and direction, the change of velocity can
occur in two ways. In our previous example, when you rode (your bicycle along
the curved path, the change of velocity occured at every tum and you ars
accelerated. Although you travelled the whole path with uniform speed,
acceleration took place due to change of direction only. If you tied a stone with
a string, as in the previous example, and rotated it over your head with uniform
speed then the rotating stone would change its direction of motion continuously.
That is, change of velocity will occur and acceleration will takes place.
If your motion is linear, then there is no scope of changing the direction. Then
acceleration may occur only for the change of magnitude of the velocities
(speed). When the magnitude of the velocity increases, then we can say
positive acceleration is taking place along the direction of the velocity. If the
velocity decreases, then we can say negative acceleration or deceleration is taking
place. Now we can determine the acceleration of an object moving along a
straight line.

Motion 43
In this chapter we will discuss only the linear motion i.e. if the change in
magnitude of the velocity occurs then only acceleration will takes place.
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time. If the acceleration is
uniform i.e. it will not change with time, then we can write;
(final velocity-initial velocity)
acceleration= ——M

If the velocity of an object at a certain time is u and after time t the velocity
becomes v, then the acceleration a will be;

and final velocities.
The examples of motion we see around us, such as the motion of a car, train or a
bicycle etc. have their accelerations as non-uniform almost all the time. For
example, if a car starts its motion from rest and increases its velocity gradually,
then starting from zero its acceleration reaches a particular value. When the car
attains its peak velocity, then its velocity does not increase any further and
3 theacceleration becomes zero again. If the car reduces its velocity and ceases it
=


--- Page 49 ---
44 Physics
motion, then retardation starts. If the car ceases its motion, then both its velocity
and acceleration become zero. You may think that the examples of uniform
acceleration are rare.
There is an amazing example of uniform acceleration which we see in our
surroundings. That is the acceleration due to gravity. Near the earth’s surface, the
value of this acceleration is 9.8 ms™. If we release an object from rest from above the
carth, then its velocity increases according to the equation v = gz.
2.7 Equations of Motion
Since we discuss only linear motion, the quantities we have talked about so far
are:

u: initial velocity

a: acceleration

t: elapsed time

v: velocity after elapsed time

s: distance covered in elapsed timed
Almost all the relationship among these quantities, are done already, only one is
left, which is the relationship for the distances. If an object has no acceleration,
then there is no change in its velocity. Then the initial velocity and the final
velocity will be equal i.e.(u = v). Therefore the distance covered will be,

s=uvt
If there is uniform acceleration, the final velocity is:
v=u+at

This equation shows that the velocity is changing with time. The entire
duration is divided into many tiny equal intervals, the distance covered in each
small interval will not be the same. This is because the particle's velocity chang-
es constantly due to acceleration. However, to calculate the total distance trav-
eled, these varying distances must be summed. Calculus, a specialized branch of
mathematics, is used to perform such calculations. However, if the particle's
acceleration is uniform, it is possible to determine the total distance traveled .
without using calculus =

equation s = vt but if we consider an average velocity then we can write

The final velocity of the car is

2.8 Laws of Falling Bodies
We have already mentioned that an amazing example of uniform acceleration is
acceleration due to gravity g. Due to its effect an object falls downward when it
is released from above the earth surface. Observing these types of falling bodies
Galileo invented three laws. The laws can be used in case of bodies falling
freely. The laws are as follows:

First law: All bodies falling from rest and from the same height without any

resistance traverse equal distance in the same time.

Second law: The velocity (v), acquired by a freely falling body from rest in

a given time (7) is directly proportional to that time. i.e.v oc t

Third law: The distance (/) traversed by a freely falling body from rest in a

given time (7) is directly proportional to the square of the given time. i.e.

] hoc t?
BS


--- Page 53 ---
48 Physics
We have mentioned earlier that the acceleration due to gravity is an example of
uniform acceleration. The equations we have deduced about motion, can be used
to deduce the equations of motion of the falling bodies. In case motion s was used
to indicate the travelled distance, for a falling body we will use h to indicate height.
For acceleration we will use g instead of a. These two will be the only difference!

v=u+ gt

= 1 2

h=ut+ 3 gt

v2 =u?+2gh
The three laws of falling bodies of Galileo are nothing but these equations of
motion of falling bodies.
The first law states that all objects released from the same height will reach the
ground at the same time i.e. it does not depend on the mass of the objects. This
does not go with the experience of our daily lives. If a piece of paper and a piece
of stone are released from the same height, at the same time, then the stone reaches
the ground first and the paper reaches the ground later. This happens due to the
resistance of air. If the experiment is done in a vacuum tube then both the paper
and stone will reach the ground at the same time. Galileo's first law can be
understood from the equation of falling bodies. This is because there is no mass of
object in the equations of velocity and traversed height. That is the acceleration
due to gravity acts equally on both heavy and light objects. So the freely falling
body traverses equal distances in the same time.
The second law of Galileo is the law of increase of velocity due to g. If the initial
velocity u is zero then velocity v is proportional to g. Galileo's third law is nothing
except the equation of 4. In this formula ifwe consider #=0 then we see that
traversed distance / is proportional to t2

Therefore, p= O00 102,000 m = 5,102 km
2x98
Though it is felt that there is no mistake anywhere but actually the answer is not
correct. This is because we have considered the value of acceleration due to
gravity is 9.8 m/s?, this is true for the distances near the surface of earth. But if
we go far from the earth the value of g will decrease. When we deduced the
equation
v2 =u? —2gh

then we considered that the value of g is not changing. It is not true for this
problem. So what we have learned till now, that knowledge cannot be used to
solve this problem. If we cannot solve it, there will be no loss; because if
anything is thrown upwards with this high velocity it will be burnt due to air
friction!

We need to mention something here. Whenever we have discussed distanc-
es travelled, velocity or acceleration we always considered a
standard situation. We considered that when an object moves, there is no
friction and the object does not lose its energy by any other means. That
does not happen in real life. That is why it is not so easy to collect real data
for distances travelled, velocity or acceleration. For performing a real
experiment an air track is used in the laboratory, where an object is kept
floating in an air layer so that no friction is present. To measure the change
of position of an object with respect to time, electric sparks or electronic
signals are used. We will not get such type of data in our daily lives easily.
For now we will consider that we have collected some data in this standard
situation, to use in our graph. Two sets of data have been shown in the table S

The distance — time graph of the first data set of the table is shown in figure
a 2.09. We have taken data in integer form. From the graph we will be able to

find the distance of any time from 0 to 5s. For example the distance of the
object in 2.5 second is approximately 6.25m. If we have a velocity versus
time graph, from there we can find the velocity easily. Velocity of an object
is the rate of change of its position. So we can see from the graph the object
has travelled a distance of 0 m to 1 min 0 to 1 second. Therefore the average
velocity at this time,

1-0
,od-0m_ m/s
1s
We can use this average velocity for the mid-time value of 0 to Is. Similarly
the average velocity within 1 to 2s is,
(4-1)m

VES Doms
We can use this velocity as data for the time 1.5 s within 1 to 2s. Similarly
we see the average velocity between 2 s and 3 s is 5 m/s, between 3 and 4 s
is 7 m/s and between 4 s and 5 s is 9 m/s. We see these data points are on a
straight line on a graph paper and we can connect the points by drawing a
straight line. Although we have put the data for time 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5
s, but we can find the velocity at any time after drawing a straight line
through these points. For example at time 3 s the velocity is 6 m/s.
We will be able to find the acceleration in the same way after drawing the
velocity -time graph of figure 2.09. Acceleration is the rate of change of
velocity. Since the velocity- time graph is a straight line, so in this case we
will get the same value of the acceleration at any point on the graph. For
example the rate of change of velocity in between the time 2's to 3 s is,

(6-4 m/s ,

a= Gos - 2m/s

For any other time if we calculate the acceleration, the same value will be
found. It is shown in the acceleration- time graph in figure 2.09.

Motion 53
Therefore, you have seen that we have found velocity or acceleration
at any time starting from the distance- time graph. To more accurately
we draw this graph, the more precisely we calculate those quantities.
Now, use the second set to calculate velocity and acceleration from
graph.

Procedure:
1. Taking a plank or a bench or a table, measure its length (L) by a ruler or
meter scale. This distance will be the distance travelled by the object.
2. By placing a book under one end of the plane plank or bench or table let
us make it inclined. Measure the height (h) of that end Dividing height
by length, find the slope (sin =h/L).
3. Put a marble or a pencil or a pen on the inclined plane and make sure
that it can roll.
4. You have to measure the time taken by the marble to travel the length of
the inclined plane. A stop watch is needed to measure the time accurately.
But it is unlikely to have a stop watch available. (Now a days stop watch
option is available in many mobile phones. You use the method given
below). If you have a normal watch instead of a stop watch, you will be at
a disadvantage. Because normal watch cannot measure less than a second.
‘We need to measure more accurately. If we have no stop watch, we can try
to measure the time by other means. How many numbers (one, two,
three, .....) can you count in fifteen seconds at normal speed?
Let us consider if you count up to forty five in fifteen seconds, then we can
assume to utter every number in approximately 1545 = 1/3 second.
Let the marble or pencil or pen move on the inclined plane and start
counting one, two, three and so on. Up to which number could you count
for the the marble, pencil or pen to reach the lower end of the inclined
plane. Calculate the actual time by multiplying with the approximate
multiple.
5. Repeat the experiment several times and calculate the average time.
6. Calculate the speed, dividing the length of inclined plane by the average
time. This is average speed.
7. Increase the slope of the inclined plane by placing another book.
Measure the new height after placing the second book. Calculate the slope
for this height.

8. Let the marble, pencil or pen roll on the inclined plane again. Measure
the time by counting the numbers and calculate the speed again. Increase
the slope gradually and calculate the average speed every time.

9. Draw a graph by plotting sin along the X-axis and average speed along
Y-axis. From the graph calculate the speed for any slope.

Playing with different kinds of motion.

Objective: To find the differences among different kinds of motion
through games.
Requirement : Small open space.
Procedure:
1. You have to select definite activities to explain different kinds of
motion.
Linear motion: You have to run straight, if you face any obstructions
you have to turn back and go straight again.
3 Rotational motion: Spreading your hands on two sides starts rotating.

Translatory motion: Looking in a particular direction move back and
forth and left and right.

Periodic motion: You have to run along a circular path and repeat
several times.
Oscillatory motion: Raise your hands and oscillate them left and right.

2. Those who are interested in playing this game will stand scattered
around the room.

3. An instructor will loudly say the words linear, rotational, translatory,
periodic or oscillatory motion.

4. Everyone has to perform the activities of the game as instructed by the
instructor. Those who will fail to follow the instructions will be
knocked out.

5. The instructor of the game will utter different motions at different

times and the boys and girls have to act out that motion.

The person who will be able to demonstrate all kinds of motion perfectly,

he or she will be declared the winner.

Keeping the fundamental characteristics of the motions unchanged, the

activities of different motions can be changed as necessary. For example,

the instructions may be given to demonstrate two different motions at the
same time. In case of linear and oscillatory motion the participant have to
run straight by oscillating his or her hands left and right.

Discussion: Write down some addtional names of different motions

which can be demonstrated.

Investigation 2.03

To determine the speed of moving vehicles.

Objective: Determination of speed of different kinds of vehicles by
measuring the distances travelled at different times.

Apparatus: Ruler.

Working Procedure:

1. To determine the speed of a vehicle, at first you have to measure the
distance between two stationary objects beside a road (e.g. light post, Tree,

shop etc). Measurement of distance very accurately may be complex that’s

why we will use a simple way to do it. At first you have to measure the
distance of your step by a ruler. (Measure the distance of ten steps and -
divide it by ten to make it accurate). s


--- Page 62 ---
Motion 57
2. Now walk from one stationary object to another object on road sides.
Count the number of steps you need to travel the distance and
multiply it by the distance of your single step to calculate the distance. It
will be better if the distance is approximately hundred meters.

3. Now try to measure the speed of a bicycle, rickshaw, tempo or a
pedestrian staying at a safe distance beside the road. Since the distance is
known, you can measure the required time, then speed can be calculated.
4. To measure the time accurately a stop watch is required, or an ordinary
watch will meet up the purpose instead of a stop watch. If you have none,
you can use an easy method to measure the time. It takes almost one
second to utter the words “one thousand one”, “one thousand two”, “one
thousand three” etc. Counting like this we can measure it.
5. When you will see a cycle, rickshaw, tempo or a pedestrian just passing
the first stationary object, you start to count time with a watch, or start
counting “one thousand one”, “one thousand two” and so on. Again when
you will see this vehicle just passing the second stationary object, you
see the time on the watch or stop counting the numbers. Find the required
time from the watch or up to which number of words you have counted,
This is the time to travel the distance.
Calculate the speed dividing the distance by the time.
Discussion: Compose your procedure of measuring time with the time of
a watch and see how accurate is it. Guess the percentage of error of your
calculated speed considering the degree of accuracy of your step
measuring procedure.

3.1 Inertia and Concept of Force- Newton’s First law of motion
In the previous chapter we have learned about velocity, speed, acceleration (and
deceleration), elapsed distance and their mutual relationships. We have deduced
the equations of motion and applied them to solve problems related to motion as
well. In this chapter we will learn how motion can be created or motion can be
influenced by applying force. We may begin with Newton’s First law.

Newton’s First law of motion: Newton’s first law of motion can be

expressed as-

A stationary object will remain stationary and an object in uniform motion

will continue its uniform motion unless a force is applied to it. (Since

velocity is a vector quantity, for uniform motion the object will not change

its direction of motion; it will move along a straight line at uniform speed.)
The first part of Newton’s first law is not difficult to understand because we
always observe that the bodies at rest remain at rest and do not move until they
are pushed. The problem arises from the second part, because we never observe that
a body in motion keeps its perpetual motion for ever. If motion is produced in a
body by pushing it, we observe that the body comes to rest if no force is applied.
From our daily life experiences it seems that to keep a body in uniform motion
we have to apply force on it continuously. Form Newton's first law we learnt
that it is not true. If a body in uniform velocity stops then we have to realize that
force has been applied by some means. Friction, air resistance etc. actually stops
a moving body by applying force in the opposite direction. If all these forces
could be withdrawn, then we would find that a body in uniform motion keeps its
perpetual motion for ever.
3.1.1 Inertia
The characteristic that a stationary body wants to be stationary or a body in
motion wants to keep its motion, unless a force is applied, is called inertia. When
a car at rest suddenly starts moving we move backwards, this is an example of
inertia. The lower part of the body is attached to the car. When the car starts
moving, the lower part of the body moves with the car but the upper part of the

& body is still stationary and tends to remain stationary. So the upper part of the
5


--- Page 69 ---
64 Physics
body move backwards. Since this inertia is due to the tendency of rest, this is
called inertia of rest.
‘When people get down from moving bus, train etc we see they fall downdue to
the inertia of motion. The whole body of the person in a moving train or bus is
in motion. When his or her leg touches the ground, the lower part of his/her
body comes to rest, the upper part of the body keeps moving forward due to the
inertia of motion. So the person falls down.
@ Do Yourself
Keep a card on a glass. Place a metal coin on the card and flip the card and
displace it. The coin will fall into the glass.
You definitely observed it that the object with higher mass cannot be displaced
by higher amount by the application of an equal amount of force. But a body
with less mass can be displaced easily. Or otherwise we can say, if the mass is
increased then inertia is increased as well.
0) Example
Question: The two graphs illustrate the values of position and velocity with time
in figure 3.01, explain where and for what period force was applied?
Answer: Both the graphs are identical to look, but they contain totally different
information.
(i) In the first graph, from 0 to ¢, or from ¢, to the end, there is no change in
position in these two time intervals, this means there is no velocity, therefore
there is no question of change of velocity. This means definitely no force is
acting in these two time intervals. From time #, to £,, there is a change in position,
but the change is at the same rate (since the line is a straight line), that means the

object is moving with a uniform velocity. Therefore, there is no change in
velocity. Therefore, from time 7, to #, no force is applied on the body. At the
instant #,, a force is applied on the stationary object to make it move with a
uniform velocity. Again just at the instant #,, by applying a force the motion is
stopped. No force is applied elsewhere.
Therefore, when 0 <t<t;, t; <t<t;and t, < t there is no force.
Only when, 7 =¢, and t = t, force is applied for a moment.
(ii) In the second graph, the object is in uniform motion; from 0 to #, and from
t, to the end, therefore no force is applied on the body during these time
intervals. From time /, to #,, the velocity is changing at a uniform rate, therefore, definitely
a force is applied on it.
Therefore, when 0 <t <t; and t, <t, there is no force.
When, t; <t <t, force is applied.

3.1.2 Force
Actually Newton’s first law of motion can be the definition of force. Force is
that quantity the application of which a stationary object start move and a body
moving, with a uniform velocity change its velocity. From Newton's first law we
can understand, what is force but cannot measure it. But from the second law, we
will learn to measure force.
When you use force in your daily life for different purposes, you may realize that
for the application of some forces it is necessary to come in contact with the
object (e.g. to lift heavy objects with the help of a crane, to push anything or
coming to rest of moving objects due to friction). Whereas you may have noticed
that for the application of some other forces, it is not necessary to come into
contact with the object (falling of anything downwards due to gravitational
force, attraction by magnets).
3.2 Nature of Fundamental Forces
If you are asked how many types of forces are there on the earth? You certainly
will say, many types. If we push anything this is a force, when a truck carries or
pulls a load this is a force, when a tree is uprooted due to a storm this is a force,
when a magnet attracts iron this is a force, when houses are blown away in bomb
blasts, it is a type of force, it is a force, when a crane lifts something this is force.
If you are given some time, you can prepare a big list of such types of forces.
But do you know the amazing matter? There are only four types of forces in
nature, if the forces described above are analyzed, you will find that they are not
outside these four types. Fundamental forces are actually only four in number.
These are; gravitational force, electromagnetic force, weak nuclear force and
strong nuclear force.
3.2.1 Gravitational Force
All objects in the universe attract one another by a force due to their mass. This
force is called the gravitational force. Due to this gravitational force the stars are
revolving within the galaxy or the earth is revolving around the sun and the
moon is revolving around the earth. When the force of gravitation of the earth
works on us, we call it gravity. This gravity attracts us towards the center of the
earth i.e. pulls downwards and due to this pull we feel our weight. q
8


--- Page 72 ---
Force 67
Force of gravitation is an amazing force of physics. An object that has mass
attracts another object by the gravitational force. In this chapter, we shall discuss
the gravitational force a little bit more in detail.
3.2.2 Electromagnetic Force
We have seen, now and then, that when we comb our hair with a comb it attracts
pieces of papers. We have also seen that a magnet attracts or repulses another
magnet. Though we think that electric and magnetic forces are different in
nature, actually the two forces are identical. They only appear in two forms.
Only and this electromagnetic force can attract and repulse but the other forces
can attract only, cannot repulse. It is so much stronger than gravitational force
(10° times, or trillion trillion trillion times stronger). That the statement is true,
you can definitely guess. Because when you comb your hair by a comb and pull
a piece of paper by attraction, the whole earth tries to pull the piece of paper
by the gravitational force due to its total mass. But the small amount of
electricity in your comb defeats the total gravitational pull of the giant earth.
3.2.3 Weak Nuclear Force or Weak Force
It is called weak because it is weaker than the electromagnetic force
(approximately trillion times weaker) but not at all weak like the gravitational
force. The force of gravitation and the electromagnetic force can act from any
distance but this force acts for very small distance (10 m). The emission of beta
(B) rays or electrons from a radioactive nucleus is due to this weak nuclear force.
3.2.4 Strong Nuclear Force
This is the strongest force of the universe; this is hundred times stronger than the
electromagnetic force but this too acts at a very small distance (10° m).
We know the nucleus is situated at the centre of the atom and the strong force
acting between the protons and the neutrons within the nucleus confines them.
Confined due to this strong nuclear force, the nucleus contains an enormous
amount of energy. Therefore by the division of a large nucleus or by the addition

“

a

S


--- Page 73 ---
68 Physics
of small nucleuses a huge amount of energy can be produced due to this force.
For this reason a nuclear bomb has so much energy. By this force light and heat
is produced in the sun.

According to scientists these four types of forces have the same origin and they are
trying to explain all these forces by a single law. Meanwhile, it has become
possible to explain the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force by a
single law. This is a tremendous success of theoretical physics. (Therefore, you
can say, forces are of three types: gravitation, electro-weak and nuclear force.
Nobody will say it is wrong). The scientists are trying to unify the other forces
too by a single law.

3.3 Balanced and Unbalanced Forces

Force is a vector quantity; therefore, if a force is applied on an object then it is
possible to cancel that force by the application of another force from opposite
direction. Then we say that the forces are balanced. When two or more forces are
applied on an object and if the combined resultant force of the forces becomes
zero then the body has no acceleration.

In figure 3.02 it is shown that an object is suspended with a thread. The force of
attraction (i.e. weight of the object) of the earth on the object is acting vertically
downwards. Again another force i.e. the tension of the thread is acting vertically
upwards. Here two forces are acting in opposite direction thus canceling each
other’s action and producing a balanced condition.

Now if the thread is cut then the tension of the thread 7 will not work on the
object. Only the force of gravity of the earth or weight will be acting downwards.
Here, the force of gravity or weight of the body is the unbalanced force. Owing
to this unbalanced force, the object will fall down with the acceleration due to
gravity.


--- Page 74 ---
Force 69
We can apply an unbalanced
force on the object without cutting
the thread too. If by pulling the i
object we displace it slightly T Li

not work in the opposite w
direction. Then the two forces 4

When the object is just released, pendulum will start movement.
this resultant force will start working on the object and the body will oscillate.
This is another example of the unbalanced force.
Three forces together can produce the balanced condition too. If a heavy book is
tied by a rope and pulled by the two terminals of the rope from two sides, it is
possible to suspend the book in a stationary state (Figure 3.03). Since the book
is in the stationary state, consequently here the weight of the book #7 and the two
tensions of the rope 7, and 7, combine to produce a zero resultant force.

@ Do yourself

Tie a heavy book by a rope and try to make it completely straight by

pulling it from the two ends. No matter how much force you apply from

both ends of the rope, you can never make it completely straight. Because

if the rope becomes completely straight then the resultant force cannot be

made zero by neutralizing the weight 7 of the book.
3.4 Momentum
Let a truck and a bicycle hit a small car with the same velocity. In this collision
which one will damage the small car more the cycle or truck? Definitely the
truck, because the truck is much heavier than the cycle. Though the
velocity of the cycle and the truck are the same, but the momentum of the truck
is much more than that of the cycle since the truck has greater mass. Simply, the
momentum is defined as the product of the mass and the velocity. If the mass of
an object is m and its velocity is V then the momentum p' can be expressed as:

p=mv
Here the mass is a scalar quantity, but the velocity is a vector, therefore the
momentum is a vector quantity. You may think that generally the mass of an
object does not change, so a change in momentum may occur only due to the
change in its velocity. But in a special case we may find that the velocity of the
object has not changed but due to the change of mass, change of its momentum
occurs. You may think, instead of defining a new term ‘momentum’, what was
the problem to always treat it as a product of mass and velocity? In general, it
does not create a big problem but in case of a ‘particle of light’ it may create
serious problems. A particle of light or a photon has no mass but it has
momentum! Compared to the mass and velocity momentum is a more
fundamental quantity.
Unit of momentum is kg m/s
Dimension of momentum is, [p] = MLT™

If more than one object are in motion and they are moving at different velocities, EB


--- Page 76 ---
Force 71

then they have a combined momentum. Due to different velocities of the objects,

they may collide with one another in their path of motion and due to the

collisions their velocities may change. If no force is applied from outside, then

after the collision the combined momentum will not change. This statement

is defined as the law of conservation of momentum.

0) Example

Question: If you throw a tennis ball at a wall with a velocity of 10 m/s, it will

bounce back towards you with the same speed. If the mass of the ball is 100 gm,

what is the change of momentum?

Answer: when the ball is thrown, then the momentum is p = mv. After striking

the wall, when the ball bounces back, its momentum becomes p’ = -mv.

Therefore the change of momentum:

p-p' =mv-(-mv) =2mv

For this change of momentum, the wall exerts a force on the tennis ball for a

very short time. In cricket, the batsman hits the ball by the bat for a very short

interval of time and the change of its momentum occurs. We call these six’s or a

boundary.

3.5 Collision

3.5.1 Conservation of Momentum and Energy

Let us consider that two objects of masses m, and m, are moving along a straight

line on a plane. Due to the difference of their velocities they collide and hence

their velocities are changed. Now, v, and v, are the new velocities of masses mm,

and m, respectively (figure 3.04). Can we find the values of v, and v, after the

collision?

The combined momentum of the two objects before collision = mu +m,u,
The combined momentum of the two objects after collision =m v +m,v,

Since, no force is applied from outside, hence the momentum before collision
" and after collision will be the same. This is the law of conservation of
H momentum. Therefore we can write,

Right now you can do this experiment. Knock a stationary marble with anoth-

er marble of the same mass so that it collides with the stationary marble.

You will observe that the knocking marble will become stationary and the

stationary marble will move with the same velocity as of the knocking

marble.
Finding the velocities of two objects after collision and using that concept we
will be able to explain the incidents of road accidents easily.
3.5.2 Safe Journey: velocity and Motion
In the next chapter we will be able to understand kinetic energy in detail when
we will learn about energy. But already we know that the kinetic energy can be
expressed by mu? while reading about collisions. The topic is very important
for discussion regarding travelling. The term kinetic energy contains the square
of the velocity, this means if the velocity is doubled then energy will increase by
four times. When two cars in an accident collide, then due to this energy both
cars are damaged and the passengers are injured. Therefore to minimize the loss
in an accident, the easiest way is to keep the speed low. In our country, most of
the accidents occur due to the speeding of cars. Then it becomes difficult to
control the cars and a huge amount of energy is used up when the accident
occurs.
Let us consider that a head-on collision occurred between a heavy truck (m,)
loaded with stone and a small car (m,) coming with the same velocity. Which
one will be damaged more?
Since a head-on collision occurred, so velocity of the small car is opposite to that
of the truck.
Therefore, if u is the velocity of the truck then the velocity of the car is —u. Since,
the mass of the small car mm, is far less than the mass m, of the truck, so if m, is
regarded as zero, the error is not too large and our calculations become easier. (If
you desire, you can calculate this by taking the mass of real bus-truck and small

VE—— =u

And
(0 —my)(—w) + 2mqu

The result is terrible. After the collision, the truck will move with the same
velocity, i.e. it will not experience the horrible nature of the collision. The
velocity of the small car will be changed from —u to 3u, that means change of
velocity is 3u- (-u)=4u, the direction of the velocity of small car will be changed
and it will fly off with four times its velocity in the reverse direction. In this
process the small car will be crumpled and destroyed. The loss of lives of the
passengers will be a very natural consequence. Again, we assume that no other
energy is exchanged here rather than kinetic energy, which is not true.
Therefore, on the roads we have to drive heavy trucks and heavy buses very
carefully, because in an accident even though these are not damaged too much,
but the small cars are damaged much more in a head-on collision with them.

3.6 Effect of Force on Motion: Newton’s Second Law
In the football ground we always see a player kicking a stationary football and
directing it to distant places by creating motion. At the time of the kick, when the
player touches the ball, only at that instant, force is applied on the ball. The
stationary ball goes into motion due to this force.
We can apply force also for a long time instead of just for a moment. By pushing
a stationary go-cart for a long time and we can release it after setting it into
motion. It can move for a while until it ceases its motion due to friction.
The direction of velocity can also be changed by the application of force. When
a bowler throws a cricket ball towards the batsman, then the batsman can direct
the ball totally in a different direction by hitting the ball with his bat.
In the three examples given above, we see that velocity is changed by the
application of force on an object for a short or a long time. In the previous
chapter we have seen that the rate of change of velocity is acceleration.
Therefore we can say, when force is applied on an object, acceleration is
produced. The relation between the force applied on a body and the acceleration
is Newton's second law.
Newton’s second law: The rate of change of momentum of a body is
proportional to the applied force acting on it and the change of
momentum also takes place in the direction in which the force acts.
If a body is moving with an initial velocity u and the velocity is changed (by
increasing or decreasing) from u to v after a time 7.
The change of momentum:
mv-mu
So, the rate of change of momentum:
mv — mu v—u)
———=m—=ma
t t
Since, we considered that there is no change of mass, so we can write like this.
Further we know that acceleration is:
v—u
a=—
Therefore if the applied force is F, then we can write Newton's second law of
motion as:


--- Page 81 ---
76 Physics
mao F
But we don’t want to express the law in proportional form, rather we want to
write it as an equation.
In that case, using a proportionality constant k, we can write
F = kma
In case of Newton's second law it is possible to create an amazing result. Since
the term ‘force’ is not explained anywhere, (Newton's first law gives the concept
only) by using the second law this will be measured for the first time. So, we
have to give a value for the constant. We can say, when Newton's second law
will be applied, if the proportionality constant is considered as 1, then the
equation we will get is the measure of force. How easily a proportionality
relation is converted into an equation.
Therefore, we can write Newton's second law of motion as an equation. If the
force is F and the proportionality constant is considered as 1, then
That this small and simple equation can make a revolutionary change in the
world of physics is difficult to believe.
Unit of force is Newton (N).
Dimension of force is [F] = MLT?

We should remember that Newton’s second law of motion is true not only for
linear motion, but this is true for any type of motion. We have known about grav-
itational force, by using Newton’s second law, we will be able to explain the
motion of the planets revolving around the sun due to the gravitational force. But
in this book, we will limit the use of Newton’s second law only to linear motion.
If force is applied on an object, then by using Newton’s second law, its
acceleration can easily be determined. (If force is divided by mass, acceleration
can be found). If acceleration is known, the velocity or distance travelled

.
can be determined by using the laws of motion. a

Otherwise we can say that if we see an object in motion and can calculate its
acceleration, then if its mass is known, it is possible to calculate the force acting
on it.
Now we look at some examples.

(b) velocity after 10's,

(c) force is applied up to 10 s, since force is applied no more, therefore, after
reaching the velocity of 200 m/s, its velocity will be unchanged. That is,
velocity after 20 s is 200 m/s.

3.7 Gravitational Force
We have talked about force (which creates acceleration), how it is measured has
been discussed (product of mass and acceleration). But until now you have not
been introduced to a real force. In physics, an amazing force is the gravitational
force; a body having mass attracts another body by the gravitational force. Let
us consider two masses mm and m, and the distance between them is 7. Then if the ES

F= G2
Tr
Here, G is the gravitational constant and its value is:
6.67 x 1011 Nm?kg 2
We have to remember that the mass mz, attracts mass m, towards itself by the
force F; also the mass m, attracts mass m, towards itself.
Of the two masses, if one is our earth
and we consider that the mass of the r
earth is M and we let another body of m m,
mass m be kept over the earth’s surface, . oo
. Figure 3.07: Gravitational
then, the earth will attract the mass m
3 force between two masses
towards its centre by a force F.
mM
F=6Fe
This force is actually the weight of the object. Here, R is the distance of the
object of mass m from the centre of the earth. This is not the distance of mass m
from the earth’s surface. Since the earth radius is too large (approximately 6370
km), therefore the small distances over the earth surface are not considered. The
distance is measured from the centre of the earth because for a spherical body if
it is considered that all its mass is centered at the centre, then no error occurs.
(Because each point of the earth attracts the mass m towards itself and if all the
attractions are assembled, it seems that the total mass is concentrated at the
centre of the earth!)
The mass m experiences acceleration due to the force of gravitation of the earth.
Already we have said that the acceleration due to gravity is expressed by g instead
ofa.
Therefore instead of F = ma we can write,
mM
Cg =m9
or, g= Ga
S Now, the mass of the earth, M = 5.98x10* kg, radius of the earth, R = 6.37x10° m,

Using Newton's second law of motion is quite simple. For each mass, Newton's
second law should be applied in every direction, with the vector sum of forces on
the left side of the equation and the mass multiplied by acceleration on the right
side. Since force and acceleration are vector quantities, both the magnitude and
the direction must be considered. According to the conventions, the quantities
pointing to the right are considered positive, while those pointing to the left are
regarded as negative. Similarly, the quantities directed upwards are treated as
positive, whereas those directed downwards are treated as negative.

one tension force acting in a string, and this tension Tr
always acts along the string and away from the
object. In this case, both the tensionTand the accel- M

upward normal force N. Since the resultant of these two forces is zero, there is
no acceleration of the mass m in the vertical direction.
Two forces are acting on the second mass: the gravitational force Mg acting
downward and the tension force T (the same tension T acting on each part of the
same string) acting upward. Since the tension force acts along the string and
away from the object, we can apply Newton's second law to find:
T-Mg =M (-a)
Here, a negative sign is placed before the acceleration because the acceleration
of the mass M is directed downward, and since both objects are connected by the
string, the magnitude of the acceleration of mass M is also a. By solving the two
equations above, we find that a=Mg/(M+m)
Using this acceleration we can explain the motion of the object located on the
table.

Answer: weights from two sides using pulley.
Here, three objects are connected by two strings, resulting in the same
acceleration for all of them. The 10 kg mass will move downward, and the mass
m will move to the left, and the 5 kg mass will move upward. Let's denote the
acceleration as a.Two tension forces will act along the two strings: T_1
(connected to the 5 kg mass) and T_2 (connected to the 10 kg mass).
By applying Newton's laws of motion in the vertical direction for the 5 kg mass,
we get:
T1-5g=5a
For the 5 kg mass, T_1 acts upward. Using Newton's second law horizontally for
the mass m, we obtain:
“T2+T1=m(-a)
Here, the force T_2 acts to the left, the force T_1 acts to the right, and the
acceleration of the mass mis directed to the left.
The mass mexperiences a downward gravitational forcemg and an upward
normal force N in the vertical direction, Because the resultant of the two forces
is zero, the mass m does not accelerate in the vertical direction. Now, applying
Newton's laws of motion vertically to the 10 kg mass, we find:
T2-10g=10(-a).
For the 10 kg mass, T_2 acts upward.
By solving the three equations above, we find that the combined acceleration of
the objects is given bya=5g/(10+5+m) and the total force acting on the mass is
given by-T2+TI=-5g+15a. However, it is not possible to determine the value of
acceleration without knowing the mass m. sg

Rubber Band Spring Balance

A spring balance is used to measure the weight of small objects. It is less

likely that all of you have a spring balance. So, to serve the purpose you

can make a spring balance with the help of a rubber band. You can use the

plastic lid of a container as a pan to keep a weight. Make four equidistant

holes round the pan and tie with a string. Now hang the pan from one end of

a rubber band. Attach the other end of the rubber band to a board with the

help of a paper clip. Now hang the board in a suitable place.

Figure 3.11: A spring balance made of a rubber band

Put a black dot on the string from which you have hanged the pan with the

rubber band. When there is no weight on the pan, put a black spot on the

board where the black spot of the string remains. This point indicates zero

mass. Now put five coins of five taka in the pan. Since mass of each coin is

8 gm, hence total mass will be 40 gm. Then put another black mark on the

board where the black spot of the string stays. This indicates mass of 40 gm.

Now draw a line from 0 gm to 40 gm marking points and divide the line into

four equal parts. Each division equals 10 gm mass. Now increase the length

of the line and calibrate it to measure more mass. Divide the line

accordingly, as much accurately as you want to measure the mass.

Now your rubber band balance is ready, now with this balance you will be
o able to measure the mass of small objects around you. If you have an actual

3.8 Newton’s Third Law
We have learnt from Newton’s first law what happens when no force is applied.
‘We have learnt from Newton's second law what happens when a force is applied.
‘We will learn from Newton's third law what type of reaction takes place between
the two objects when an object applies force on another object.
Newton’s Third Law: When an object applies a force on another object,
then that object also applies a force of equal magnitude on the first object
but in the opposite direction.
In physics, generally Newton's third law is written as, “Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction”, although we have not written it in this form. By this time
since we have a little idea about force, confusion may occur if force is termed as
“action” or “reaction” “suddenly”. Moreover, those who are the new learners of
physics, their first question will be if every reaction (a force) has an opposite
reaction (another force) then why action and reaction are not cancelling each
other, producing zero? For this reason, the third law will have to be written very
precisely. The third law states that if there are two objects A and B, then when A
exerts a force on B, then B also exerts a force on A. It is worth mentioning that
two opposite forces act on different objects, never on a single object. If the two
forces were applied on a single object, only then one could cancel the other. Here
there is no scope of cancellation.

This is so negligible that nobody is bothered about it! Next time when you jump
anywhere, remember that you attract the whole earth towards you when you fall
downwards. (As small as the acceleration of the earth may be, you pulled the
whole earth towards you, you may be little proud of it!)
The easiest way of understanding Newtons third law is to understand the
mechanism of our walking. We can all walk but nobody knows the physics
hidden behind this. Since you have started to learn physics a simple question can
be put to you. Since you have walked

third law cannot be achieved properly. The matter can be clarified more, if one
is allowed to walk on a very smooth surface lubricated with soap-water or oil!
There friction is hardly present so we cannot apply a backward force at all and
due to this we will not get any force on us as the reaction force. So we cannot
walk at all (You may try if you don’t believe it). If force is applied, equal and
opposite force is found, but if we cannot apply force at all, how can we get a
reaction force? Then how can we walk?

Therefore the stone and you will move in different directions. By pushing the
stone you cannot move it from one end to the other. Because a distance will be
created between you and the stone. So it is not possible to push the stone nonstop
for 10 s. But after the stone starts its movement, it will reach the other end

Answer: In 2 s the velocity of the stone will be increased to:

Then the stone will move with a uniform velocity of 1 m/s.
In 2 s your velocity will be:
ut+at=0+1x2m/s =2m/s
Then you will move in the reverse direction with a uniform velocity of 2 m/s.

so if T apply a force on the wooden piece from the left too, then since the applied

frictional force is increased also, though the weight and the force of friction are
normal to each other.

or the grooves of the two surfaces in
contact catch onto one another. The
motion is obstructed due to this and we say frictional force is developed in the
opposite direction. If the two surfaces are pressed more, then the scratched
surfaces make better contact with one another, the grooves of one surface will
penetrate into the other’s grooves more deeply and as a result the frictional force
will be increased.
Due to friction heat is generated. It is a problem in most cases. When a piston in
a cylinder moves back and forth in a car, due to friction heat is generated there
and to control this heat, the engine of the car needs to be cooled.
3.9.1 Types of Friction
Friction is divided into three types. These are, static friction, kinetic friction,
and rolling friction.
Static friction: The frictional force that develops when two objects are at rest
relative to each other is called static friction. Due to static friction we can walk,
our legs or shoe soles rub against the ground and we don’t slip.
Kinetic friction: The frictional force that is create when an object is in motion
relative to another object is called kinetic friction. When anyone grips the brake

of a cycle, it presses the wheel and ceases the motion of the rotating wheel due
to kinetic friction. The kinetic friction depends on the weight of the moving
body, the more the weight, the more the kinetic friction. If an object has a mass
M, then its weight W= Mg is a force. Then the kinetic friction can be written as,
f= uW, u is the coefficient of kinetic friction.
Rolling friction: When an object moves by rolling or revolving on a surface
then the friction that develops is called the rolling friction. Among all the
frictional forces, this is the least, so we attach wheels on all kind of vehicles. It
is very easy to pull suitcases attached with wheels, if suitcases have no
wheels, it would become very difficult for us to pull it on the floor.

Static friction and Kinetic friction
Take several empty match boxes. Fill up the boxes with soil to make
them slightly heavier. Now put a match box on a book and keep sliding
the book gradually (Figure 3 .18). Due to the static friction the match will
not slide at first. When the book becomes sufficiently inclined, then
along the slope a force works. At the instant when this force equals the
sliding frictional force, then the match box will start sliding. You will see
that only for a particular angle of inclination the match will start moving.
Putting one or more match boxes over the first one repeat the experiment;
you will see that every time for a particular angle the match box will start
moving.
3.9.2 Effects of friction on motion
We already discussed that the frictional force always acts opposite to the applied
force. Therefore, naturally the frictional force slows down the motion and it may
o be our assumption that perhaps we always try to reduce the friction. But that is
S not true. Sometimes you may have seen that a car or a truck is stuck in mud.


--- Page 97 ---
92 Physics
Though the wheel of the car rotates but due to less friction, the car or truck
cannot come out from the mud. The wheel slides. Then to rescue the car or truck,
the friction between the wheel and the mud is increased in an alternate way.
Tyre’s Surface: Because of the friction between the car’s tyre and the road the
car can move on the road. If this friction was not present, then the tyre of the
car would slip and the car would not be able to move forward. To increase this
friction many types of grooves are designed on the tyre (Figure 3.19). Those
who drive cars always give attention to whether the grooves of the car are
smooth or flat. If the grooves become flat, then after applying the brakes the car
will slip instead of stopping.
Smoothness off road: The roads are specially designed to increase the friction
between the tyre of the car and the road. -

Controlling Motion and Breaking Force:
The speed of the vehicle has to increase or decrease according to the necessity
when we drive the vehicles. When the speed of the car is low, then it is easier to
control it. You can often see that during taking a turn or overtaking another car,
the speed of the car is lowered by applying the brakes.
When the driver presses on the brake pedal, this is transferred to the shoe or pad
attached to the wheel and the shoe presses down on the disc located inside the
wheel. Due to this pressure friction develops between the pad and disc and this
frictional force stops the motion of the wheel of the car. a

3.9.3 Increase and Decrease of Friction
Already we know that for our necessity sometimes friction has to be increased
and sometimes it has to be decreased.
Reducing friction
The measures we may take to reduce friction are: en
1. Make the surfaces as smooth as possible 7 $= EN
where friction is take place. On smooth ‘TERY
surfaces sliding friction is less. = r I —| |
2. Oil, Mobil or grease like materials are called 1 \ og
greasy materials or lubricants. The friction is Ao, Sly
reduced to a great extent if lubricants are used ~ 24
in between the two surfaces.
Figure 3.20: Using ball bearing, friction canbe ~~ Figure 3.20: It is possible to
reduced to a great extent reduce friction by using ball
bearings.

3. Using wheel friction can be reduced. If wheel is used we can do work by very
small rolling friction instead of large sliding friction. It is possible to reduce
friction to a great extent by using ball bearings in the rotating wheel, using the
rolling friction of the small steel balls instead of the direct friction.
4. The design of the fast moving vehicles like car, plane is done in such a way
that the wind can flow over the streamline surface without creating any friction.
5. The surfaces where friction occurs touch one another in a very small region,
then friction can be reduced.
6. We have seen that if force is applied on the two frictional surfaces, friction is
increased. Therefore if vertically applied force is reduced, friction can be
reduced.
Increasing friction
If the procedures that are taken to reduce friction are not done or if the opposite
steps are taken then friction will be increased. Therefore the necessary steps we
take to increase the friction are:

=o 1. Roughening the two surfaces where friction is present.

Bl


--- Page 99 ---
94 Physics
2. Pressing the two surfaces more strongly where friction is present.
3. Make the surfaces stationary by stopping the motion which is present on the
two frictional surfaces. Because static friction is more than the sliding friction.
4. Making grooves or waves on the frictional surfaces. Then it can grip the
bottom tightly. If there is water or liquid, it enters the grooves thus reducing
the friction of the surface.
5. To increase the density of air or water.
6. To increase the frictional area in air or water.
7. To remove wheel or ball bearing.
3.9.4 Friction: An essential hazard
All of us have certainly noticed that heat is generated due to friction. In the
winter we create heat by rubbing our hands. The engine of a car becomes hot
that happens due to friction. Therefore, energy is dissipated by creating
unnecessary heat due to friction. Cars, planes, ships, submarines have to go
forward by overcoming the frictional force, requiring extra fuel. If we treat this
in this way, it may seem that friction is nothing but an evil in our lives.
Meanwhile, we have seen that due to friction we can walk, drive cars on the
road, write on the paper with pencil or pen, construct buildings, come down safely
with the help of a parachute. We can give many examples where without friction
we could not do our necessary work.
Consequently though friction is treated as an evil, we have to acknowledge that
friction is a very necessary evil for our lives.

In this chapter we will see how force works. In terms of physics the word "work"
has a specific meaning. We will see that a force working on something can move
it and create kinetic energy. This kinetic energy can convert into potential energy
and this transformation of energy is a very natural process and different types of
energy can convert into one another.

One of the important aspect of science is energy and energy plays a most
important role for the development of mankind. So, how energy can be explored
from nature will also be discussed.

4.1 Work
We use the term ‘work’ in various ways in our daily life. A gatekeeper
guarding a house all day long, sitting on a tool, may claim to have done a lot of
work, but in the words of physics that is not any work. In terms of physics the
word ‘work’ is well defined. If a force F is applied on any object and the object
traverses a distance s during the application of force (that is displacement
occurs) then, the amount of work # done by the force is:
W=Fs

Unit of work: J (Joule)

Dimension of work [W] = ML2T 2
Force is a vector quantity and the distance traversed or the displacement is also a
vector quantity but in case of work the product of those two vectors is a scalar
quantity.
As individual vectors there is no such condition that the direction of force and
distance travelled has to be same but in these book, we will only discuss the
force and distance travelled in the same direction.
Have you noticed, while discussing work, we said that the “force” has done the
work. A person or a machine may push any object to some distance by applying
a force. In terms of daily life we say that the person or the machine has done the
work. But in physics, neither the person nor the machine does the work, always
the force applied does the work. This force may be applied by a person or a
machine.
Let us assume that, you have pushed an object to a distance s by applying a force
F and left it after setting it in motion. The object has travelled an additional
distance d and at last it has stopped. How much work is done?
The amount of work done is W=Fs, as no force was applied while traversing the
distance d, so no work is done.


--- Page 106 ---
‘Work, Power, Energy 101

0) Example

Question: Your mass is 50 kg. You have climbed up a 10 storied building, how

much work have you done? (Height of each floor is 3 m)

Answer: If your mass is 50 kg, your weight is 50 x 9.8=490 N. This weight is a force,

that is acting downwards. If you want to climb up, you have to exert an equal

force upwards to draw yourself up.

So, upward applied force: 490 N

Distance travelled upwards: 10 x 3 m=30 m

So the amount of work done, 490 N x30 m =14700 J=14.7 kJ

Suppose, a moving object is coming towards you, you try to stop the object by

applying force F, the object pushes you backwards by a distance s. How much

work was done by the force applied by you? Certainly you have noticed that, this

time the distance traversed is not along the direction of force, rather opposite to

it. So the amount of work done

W=F (-s)=-Fs

That is, the work done is negative. In our daily lives, we talk about work and

useless work, but what is meant by positive and negative work in terms of

physics? If the work is positive, then it can be said that the work is done by the force.

If it is negative, then it is said that the work is done ‘on’ the force or against the

force. We must have a clear conception about energy before understanding what

has just been written.

4.2 Energy

In our daily life we use the term “energy” for different purposes but in physics it

has a definite meaning. Generally speaking, there is no difference between

applying energy or applying force, but in physics, these two phrases mean

completely different things. In the previous chapter, we have learnt what is

meant by force, what is meant by energy will be discussed in this chapter.

We all have a shallow idea about energy, because we mention the words
«electrical energy, thermal energy when we make casual conversation.
& Sometimes we even hear about chemical energy or nuclear energy. Though light


--- Page 107 ---
102 Physics
is not mentioned as energy, we can assume that light is one kind energy too. The
energy which is not mentioned in our daily conversation, but will be discussed a
lot in physics is kinetic energy. We may think that there are many types of energy
in nature, but it is interesting that all kinds of energy are the same and we can
only transform them from one to another! So what is energy?
Ability to do work is energy! Not only that, when a positive work is done by
applying a force on an object, the force creates an energy in that object. The
amount of work done on the object is the amount of energy created in it, and the
person who is applying the force has to give exactly the same amount of energy.
So now you have understood the meaning of negative work. If any force does a
negative work on an object, then it is to be understood that a certain amount of
energy is taken away from the energy contained in the object. The amount of
negative work done is equal to the amount of energy taken away, and he who has
applied the force gets this energy anyway. So, on any object

Doing positive work — giving energy to the object.
Doing negative work — taking away energy from the object.
You can clearly understand that energy has no direction and it is a scalar
quantity. As we produce energy by doing work or do work spending energy,
these two have the same unit and the same dimension.

4.3 Different forms of energy
We use different kinds of energy for different purposes. For example, heat
energy is needed for water to be heated, we need light energy to see anything, we
hear by using sound energy. We run machines by using electrical energy, and we
create electricity from electric cells by using chemical energy. We generate
electric energy too from the nuclear energy we get by dividing a heavy nucleus
or by addition of light nucleuses. Energy is developed in our body taking
nutrition from food, we perform our activities.
The history of our civilization itself is the history of utilization of energy by
generating energy. We see different forms of such energy around us, for example-
mechanical energy, heat energy, sound energy, light energy, magnetic energy,
electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy and solar energy.
The most general form of energy is the mechanical energy, the energy that is
obtained due to position, shape and motion of the object is called mechanical
energy. There are two forms of mechanical energy; these are kinetic energy and
potential energy.
4.3.1 Kinetic Energy
‘We have discussed earlier that the ability to do work is energy. Everyone of us
knows that when an object is in motion, it can push another object and set it into
motion resulting in the object moving a certain distance due to the pushing.
. Making another object move means, definitely a force has been applied there
d and traversing a distance due to this force means work is done there!


--- Page 109 ---
104 Physics
Therefore we can say firmly that the energy that develops due to motion in a
body is certainly one kind of energy or kinetic energy. In the previous chapter we
said that the terrible road accidents that happen and the losses that occur are
mainly due to kinetic energy. When a bus-truck or a car moves at high speed then
it has a huge amount of kinetic energy.
We can easily calculate how much kinetic energy is produced by an object when
work is done by a force on that object.
Let an object of mass m be displaced by an amount s due to the application of
force F. Therefore work done WW by the force F is:
W =Fs
According to Newton’s second law we know,
F=ma
Again, from the equations of motion we know that if an object starts its motion
from rest,
Then s = Sat? and v = at
Then work, W = Fs = mas = ma X Sat? = Sma? = Fm?
Therefore we can say if a force / makes a displacement s of an object then the
kinetic energy that is generated:
1
T= Sm?
Zmv
The velocity v is in the square form in kinetic energy, so to double the velocity
of an object we will need to apply four times of the energy.
‘When learning the equations of motion, we noticed that
v2 =u? + 2as

Multiplying both sides by im the equation becomes smu? = smu? + mas
If we write F instead of ma and W instead of Fis, then the equation becomes,

4.3.2 Potential Energy
When we were discussing work, we said that if a force does a positive work on
an object then energy is generated. When we were talking about kinetic energy
we gave the example of this too. We have shown that by applying a force on an
object if the object moves by a distance, then its kinetic energy becomes Smv?
Now, we will give such an example L M
where force is applied and displacement '
occurs even when no kinetic energy is \
produced. Suppose, a spring is kept on a :
table as shown in figure 4.03. You L- i Xx I

of your hand or spring is in motion, so no F x A ar
kinetic energy B present in any of them. Figure 4.02: Stationary state of a
Since the direction of applied force and ging and compressed by applied
the distance traversed is in the same force
direction, so the work done is positive. According to the definition of work, here
energy is to be created. But where is that energy? Here nothing is in motion, so
definitely there is no kinetic energy.
Those of us who have used springs can guess that energy is definitely hidden in
the compressed spring. Because if an object of mass m is kept before the
compressed spring and then released, the spring would exert a force on it and
make a displacement, which means the spring would perform work. That is it’s
a kind of energy, even it is not kinetic energy, this is another form of energy. This
type of stored energy is called potential energy. This energy is developed due to
the ‘sate or position” of the object. S

If the constant of a spring is k, and if the spring is compressed by a
distance x from its normal state, then the potential energy stored in it is,

V= 3 kx
@ Do Yourself
If a spring is compressed or expanded by an amount x, it will
exert a force of F= -kx, using this equation it is possible to find out the
relation, V = Th? Can you find it? (Since the force depends on the length
of the spring, so calculate the average force and multiply it by the total
distance.)

Question: A body of mass 10 kg falls on a spring with a velocity of 10 m/s. If
the spring constant k=100,000 J/m?, what is the compression?
Answer: Kinetic energy of the object,

This energy will compress the spring, that is,

When we raise anything, then it acquires potential energy. When a piece of stone
is released freely from above, its speed increases when it comes down. So it
develops a kinetic energy. This becomes possible because a kind of potential
© energy was stored in it when it was in the ‘above’ position. How much potential


--- Page 113 ---
108 Physics
energy is stored in a stone when the stone is raised above can also be calculated.
You are realizing that the amount of work to be done when an object is raised
above is stored in that object as potential energy. If the work done is 7,

W=Fh
Here, F is the applied force and / is the height. We have to apply the force F in
the upward direction and distance traversed is also in the upward direction,
therefore F is positive. The force that has to be applied for raising the object
upwards does not change as the spring force and this force is equal to the weight
of the stone. If the weight of the stone is mg,

F=mg
and W=mgh
We have to remember that the weight of the stone is a force and it acts
downwards. We have to apply an upward force equal to the weight of the stone
if we want to lift it.
Potential energy is stored in a stone of mass m by raising it a distance of 4. What
amount of kinetic energy will be generated in the stone if it is released and
comes down by a distance 4?
Due to the conservation of energy total of its potential energy will transform into
kinetic energy. We know kinetic energy ism, SO we can write:

z m= mgh
Vvi=2gh
Honestly we can say, when we were deducing the laws of falling bodies,
we deduced this identical law once again! Now we deduced the same law using the
conception of energy quite in a different way!

on the mass. With any mass we will get this answer. For this we might have used
the formula v=2gh directly.
Question: A body of mass 5 kg is thrown in the upward direction with a velocity
of 50 m/s. At what height will the potential and kinetic energy be the same?
Answer: Initial kinetic energy of the body is

When kinetic energy equals potential energy, then for height /, we can say

4.4 Sources of energy
The history of world civilization can be simply named as the history of
utilization of energy. It can be generally said, that a simple means to understand
how developed a country is to calculate the use of electrical energy per person in
that country. Different forms of energy of the world are shown in the figure 4.03.
oil )( Gas J Coat J Nuclear ) (Hydro) Biomass | | Solar, )( thetgy || Geothermal
Figure 4.03: Different sources of energy
4.4.1 Non-renewable Energy
As the history of civilization on earth is actually the history of energy utilization,
we see there is a hunger for energy in every country and every state in the world.
Everyone is searching for energy and using it in every possible manner.
Fuel Energy (Oil, gas and coal): At this moment, the biggest sources of energy
of the world are oil, gas or coal. Oil, gas or coal, are all fossil fuels, that is, being
buried under the ground from millions of years, are transformed into this form
due to prolonged period of heat and pressure. Coal, oil or gas are to be
extracted from beneath the ground. The oil that is extracted from the ground
(Crude oil) is very dense at the primary stage, which are converted into petrol,
diesel, or kerosene by refining in refineries and some other usable substances are
found as well. The gas that comes out from beneath the ground is mainly
methane CH,, water vapors and other gases can be mixed with it and these are to
be separated. The gas of our country Bangladesh is comparatively much clearer
and suitable for direct use. S

Work, Power and Energy 111
Nuclear Energy: Many countries are utilizing nuclear energy, and one type of
fuel is also required there which is uranium. There is a similarity in the energies,
oil, gas, coal or uranium; they are spent when they are used. Men have already
estimated the amount of uranium in the world or the amount of oil, gas or coal
beneath the ground. It is seen that if people continue to use energy at the rate they
are doing now, the sources of energy like oil, gas, coal or uranium will be
exhusted hundred years at best. After that our known sources of energy will run
out. People are not that much concerned about what will happen then, because
they are almost sure that by them some other sources will be found using science
and technology. For example, nuclear fusion, using which the sun or stars produce
their energy. The fuel for fusion comes from one isotope of hydrogen and each
molecule of water contains two atoms of hydrogen. So, there is no worry for that
to run out.
4.4.2 Renewable Energy
Human being are not only relying upon new forms of energy in the future, but at
this very moment they are also dependent on the sources of energy, which will
not be finished. This energy comes from sunlight, ebb and flow of the waves of
seas, winds in open fields, hot magma from the interior of the earth or currents
of water of rivers. It is not difficult to understand that these sources of energies
are almost inexhaustible. These are called renewable energy- i.e. the energy
which can be renewed, and because of that, there is nothing to be worried about.
At present one fifth of the energy people are using world wide is this renewable
energy. As days are going by, people are getting aware of the environment. And
so the use of this type of energy is increasing more and more.
Hydroelectricity: One fifth of the total energy of the world is renewable energy.
Most of that part is hydroelectricity, to produce electricity by making a dam in a
river. Since the water of a river is inexhaustible, therefore the source of energy
of such a power plant is inexhaustible. This is the conventional concept. But if a
dam is built on a river, it harms the environment to a great extent; due to this the
people of the world have become very conscious. Those who are a little bit
farsighted don’t build such a power plant more.
Biomass: After hydroelectricity, the most renewable energy comes from
biomass, by biomass we mean wood fuel, straw etc. People in many parts of the
world have no oil, gas or electricity; they spend their daily life by burning fuel
"- wood and straw. The used energy by these poor people is a major part of the total
H energy of the world. Even the dried tree, straw etc. are finished due to burning,


--- Page 117 ---
112 Physics
biomass is called the source of renewable energy because the trees can be grown
again. It is not lost for ever from the world like oil, gas or coal.

The important sources of energy are solar energy, wind energy, bio fuel and
geothermal energy besides the two forms of renewable energy, hydroelectricity
and biomass.

Solar energy: Many of you will be astonished on hearing that, only in one square
kilometer area we get one thousand megawatt energy from the sun as light and
heat which is close to the energy of a nuclear power plant. One part of the light
and heat that comes from the sun is absorbed by the atmosphere. It is absent at
night and uncontrolled due to cloud and rain. Beside this, the energy comes as
light and heat energy, it has to pass one step for conversion into electricity. It is
still said to be the most reliable source of energy. Utilizing solar heat electricity
can be generated. Now-a-days a common picture of the earth is the solar panel,
installing this on their roofs; people are generating their own electricity sitting in
their own residence.

Wind energy: After solar energy, wind energy has occupied an important place
very quickly. In our country we are not familiar seeing large turbines for wind
energy, but in many countries of Europe this is a very familiar scene. The place
at which the wind mill is set up, a large tower is erected upwards, so there is no
waste of land at all, for this reason the environmentalists like it very much. From
a wind turbine it is possible to get a few megawatts of electricity! The utility of
the energy that is generated by using air; is increasing by 30% every year. This
number is not a small number at all.

Bio fuel: The people of the world are preparing alcohol for drinking purposes
from a long time- it is one kind of fuel. Preparation of alcohol as fuels from food
like popcorn and sugarcane are almost an acceptable procedure. The oil that we
use for cooking purposes can also be used instead of diesel. There are many
kinds of trees in the world from which we can get fuel oil directly. In many
countries of the world, the research on biofuel is continuing, moreover many
countries like Brazil have started using such types of biofuel on a large scale.
Geothermal energy: Another important source of renewable energy is
geothermal energy. The inner part of our earth is very hot, when a volcano’s .
eruption takes place then we become aware of it. So, if someone can make a g


--- Page 118 ---
Work, Power, Energy 113
hole a few kilometers deep, then he will get a giant source of heat energy. The
process is still not easy so its large scale use has not yet started. In some places
due to its geographical nature this type of energy is available easily and its use
has started there.

4.4.3 Transformation of energy and impact on environment

People around the world are becoming conscious about the environment. For
prosperity we need energy but the people of the modern world cannot tolerate it
if the environment is destroyed for energy. The people of the world are not ready
to use any type of energy by any means. They want to explore the energy that is
hidden in the world not by making conflicts with nature and not by destroying
the earth.

The largest example of the impact of transformation of energy on nature is the
fossil fuel or oil, gas and coal. Among these three, the amount of carbon is much
more and when these are burnt to produce heat energy then carbon dioxide gas
is produced, which is a green house gas. Therefore, this gas can confine the heat
of the world and due to this the temperature of the world is increasing slowly,
which is called global warming. Due to global warming the ice of the polar
region is melting and the height of the sea level is rising. Bangladesh is one of
the countries of the world which will be flooded and the farmlands destroyed by
salt water thus creating a harmful impact on nature. At present, all the countries
of the world are unitedly trying to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide
emission.

There is no emission of carbon dioxide in a nuclear power plant. But nuclear
wastage is highly radioactive and these have to be preserved for millions of
years for their radioactivity to reach a safe level which is not hazardous for the
environment. Though nuclear power plant is very safe due to modern
technology, sometimes owing to people's mistakes or natural calamities major
accident happens to creates a fatal disaster. Two examples of this type
areaccidents of Chernobyl of the then Soviet Union and Fukushima of Japan.
Comparatively the impact of renewable energy on the environment is less. But
when a dam is made on a river for production of hydroelectricity, then on one
hand the environment is damaged due to flooding in a large region, whereas on
the other hand, due to less flow of water draught may be created in the ao
subsequent regions.

4.5 Conservation and Transformation of Energy
4.5.1 Conservation of energy
In our daily life, the energy we see around us is imperishable. It has no
destruction, it transforms only from one form to another form. When a stone is
raised, it develops a potential energy. When the stone is released, the potential
energy starts decreasing and the kinetic energy starts increasing. Just before it
touches the ground, its total energy is converted into kinetic energy. But when
the stone stops after touching the ground, then it contains no kinetic energy and
no potential energy, where has the energy gone?

You definitely have observed that when a stone hits the ground, it hits by producing
sound and heat i.e. kinetic energy is transformed into sound or heat energy.
The example (Figure 4.04) of changing between potential and kinetic energy is
wonderful. A small stone is tied by a thread and hanged from a support. If we
pull it along one side then the stone goesup by a small amount from its
stationary position and hence a potential energy is developed in it. Now if we
release the stone, due to an unbalanced force on it, it starts going towards its
stationary state, thus creating a motion in it. When it reaches the mid position
exactly, it attains the maximum velocity. So it does not stop there rather moves
away in the opposite direction and rises up until its velocity becomes zero.
Therefore, it again develops a potential energy. When it reaches the maximum
height it stops there, owing to its potential energy again it starts moving towards
the stationary state. In this way, the stone oscillates and transformation from
potential energy to kinetic energy and kinetic energy to potential energy
continues. This process would continue for an infinite time if there was no
friction and other causes of energy loss.
Therefore,the transformation of energy is a very natural process. Transformation
of energy takes place not only between potential energy and kinetic energy. But
all the known forms of energies around us can transform from one form to another.
In our daily lives, the energy we see around us cannot be created or even can be
destroyed, it only changes from one form to another. This is the law of conservation
of energy.
4.5.2 Transformation of Energy
Around us we see many examples of transformation of energy, e.g.
(a) Electrical energy
If we want to give example of the transformation of energy, at first we give
examples of electrical energy. Because this energy can be transformed into
other energy very easily. Not only this, it is easiest to transmit electrical energy
from one place to another. Though around us there are many types of
energy, we supply electrical energy first to our residence but we don’t supply
other forms of energy. In our daily lives, we see the transformation of electrical
energy into mechanical energy in electric fans or other motors. (Though actually
magnetic energy is not different from electrical energy, even then in motor or
..  clectrical fan we see electrical energy converts first into magnetic energy and
§ then converts into mechanical energy.) In the electric iron or heater it is


--- Page 121 ---
116 Physics
converted into heat energy. The electrical energy is converted into light energy
in light bulbs, tube light or in an LED. To produce sound energy we need to
vibrate something. It's a kind of mechanical energy. Moreover we can tell, in
speakers, electrical energy is converted into sound energy. All of us charge the
battery of our mobile using electricity, where the electrical energy is converted
into chemical energy.

(b) Chemical energy

Chemical energy is certainly an important example of transformation of energy.
The gas which is used for cooking is an example of transformation of chemical
energy into heat energy. Due to this, when electrical energy is supplied to our
residence, simultaneously gas is also supplied. Due to the conversion of
chemical energy into heat energy, we also get light energy.

The light of a candle is an example. We see the transformation of chemical
energy into mechanical energy using gas, patrol, diesel or such type of fuels in
different kinds of engines. If we observe closely, we will find that at first
chemical energy is converted into heat energy and then heat energy is converted
into mechanical energy. But in the era of modern technology, the greatest
example of conversion of chemical energy is the battery, where chemical energy
is converted into electrical energy. We cannot find any space where chemical
energy is not converted into electrical energy using battery starting from mobile
phone to car or from clock to space shuttle. The amazing example of chemical
energy is our body or body of living beings, where chemical energy from food is
converted into mechanical or electrical energy.

(c) Heat energy

If we consider from the viewpoint of quantity, the conversion of maximum
amount of energy undoubtedly takes place from the heat energy in the world.
Heat energy is transformed into mechanical energy in all engines of all
machines. In thermocouple ( applying heat at the junction of two different
metals), though there are examples of conversion of heat into electrical energy
directly, actually almost in all the cases heat energy is converted into mechanical
energy and then mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy. (To save
the environment we don't like the dissipation of energy now-a-days, so we use
energy saving bulbs more instead of using light bulbs where light is produced
due to heating) We see the transformation of heat energy into light energy from
heated gas particles of flame of a candle where heat is generated from chemical a
energy or from the filament of a bulb. S

Work, Power, Energy 117

(d) Mechanical Energy

‘When electrical energy is produced bya generator, actually electrical energy

is produced by rotating a coil of wire in a magnetic field by utilizing the

mechanical energy. Heat energy is always being produced due to friction, there

mechanical energy is transforming into heat energy.

(e) Light Energy: Light is an electromagnetic wave and we can see a definite

range of the wavelengths of this wave, we call this light. Waves of wavelength

more or less than this range is present in nature and we have generated those in

different ways. For example, in a microwave oven, we convert the

electromagnetic wave into heat energy. Now-a-days using solar cell light is

transformed directly into electricity. Now-a-days the uses of photographic plate

is decreasing day by day, but all of us know that the presence of light in a photo

sensitive photographic film generates chemical energy.

(f) Mass: You are definitely surprised seeing the word ‘mass’ suddenly in

different types of transformation of energy. When we mean energy, then we

never imagine the mass as energy directly. But Einstein showed using his laws

of relativity, £ = mc? and with the help of this equation he informed us about the

possibility of transformation of mass into energy. In the nuclear bomb, the mass

was transformed into energy, where a huge amount of heat, light, and sound

energy destroyed the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This process of energy
S transformation can be used not only in nuclear bombs but also in nuclear power

118 Physics
station. Though heat is produced here directly, using this heat energy steam is
produced and this steam is used to rotate the turbine, then this rotating turbine
generates electricity in a generator(Fig: 4.05).
We have to know an important matter though such types of transformation are
taking place around us. Although there is available energy, but this energy
cannot always be used. In the oceans of the earth, there is a huge amount of
energy, but we cannot use this energy. (Sometimes using this energy cyclones
destroy cities, habitations!) When energy is transformed from one form to
another form, then a part of it is dissipated. Actually this dissipation occurs in the
form of heat energy and this cannot be regained for further use. This dissipation
of energy actually is not the limitation of technology. It is a rule restricted by
physics.
At the very beginning of learning science many don’t know it and they try to
make an everlasting machine for transformation of energy from one form to
another form. (A motor is rotating the generator and producing electricity, again
using this electricity the motor is rotating. This is an example of perpetual
machine. It will never work).
4.6 Relation between mass and energy
You know, in the theory of relativity by Einstein it is said that the mass of
an object and the energy are identical things. If the mass m is transformed into
energy, then this energy is E, and its amount is £ = mc?, here c is the light
velocity. The velocity of light (3x10% m/s) is huge, if it is squared it becomes
huge also, it means if we can transform a little mass into energy, we will get a
huge amount of energy, in a nuclear power plant just this thing is done.
In a nuclear power plant, one of the fuels that are used is uranium 235. Here
there are 92 protons and 143 neutrons. Its amount in nature is very small, only
0.7%, its half life is 703,800,000 (704 million) years. A uranium 235 nucleus can
capture another neutron very easily (if the speed of that neutron is small). Then
the uranium 235 nucleus becomes very unstable, then it is divided into two small
nuclei Kr”? and Ba'*'. In addition to this, three more neutrons come out
(Figure 4.06), which is depicted in the equation below. If anyone finds out the
mass that remains in the left side of the equation and compares it with the mass
that remains on the right side, will see that on the right side mass is less, the less
amount actually emerges out as energy governed by the equation, E= mc? . .

Figure 4.06: Energy production from nuclear reaction
In this reaction, the three neutrons that have come out, actually come out with
huge speed, so the other uranium (330) nuclei cannot capture them very
easily. If by some means their kinetic energy can be lowered, then they will be
captured by other uranium (233U) nuclei and thus will break it creating some
more energy and releasing three new neutrons. In a nuclear power plant, this
work is done, so when the speed of the emerging neutrons goes down, they again
break other nucleuses and this process continues. This process is called a chain
reaction.
In this process, a huge amount of heat energy is produced, using this heat energy
water is vaporized and turbine is rotated with the help of this vapor and
electricity is produced from the generator. This type of power plant is called a
nuclear power plant. It is possible to get thousands of megawatt power from such
a power plant very easily. The wastage material that is produced after the nuclear
reaction is terribly radioactive; so many types of precautionary measures have to
be taken when processing them. If the excess neutrons that emerge after a
nuclear reaction are absorbed somewhere else by any means, then the nuclear
reaction ceases. There is a special type of rod called a control rod to absorb the
neutrons in a nuclear reactor. These are used to control the nuclear reactor.

4.7 Power
The term "power is used a lot of times in our daily lives, and it is not that the
term is always used in a positive sense! But the word ‘power’ has a definite
meaning in physics; power is the rate of doing work. That is, if work # is done
in time t, then power P is:

w

p=—

t
We have seen before that work is nothing but transformation of energy. As
energy can’t be destroyed, so it is only being transformed by doing work. So we
can say, if we desire, power is the rate of transformation of energy. As work or
energy is a scalar quantity, then power is also a scalar quantity.
We have known about different quantities, their units, and tried to know their
dimensions in every case while learning physics. Unit and dimension of power
are:

Unit of power: W (Watt)
Dimension of power: [P] = ML*T~3

Though we have known it here for the first time, it’s unit is very familiar to us.
If 1 Joule work is done per second then we say, work done is 1 watt or
transformation of energy takes place. If we switch on a light bulb of 100 watt
that means, in this bulb 100 J energy is being spent in each second. When we
read in the newspaper that a 1000 MW nuclear power plant will be built in our
country that means in that power plant, 1000 x 10° J electrical energy will be
produced in each second.
4.8 Efficiency
We have said earlier that a certain amount of energy is wasted every time while
transforming energy from one form to another. So we have to give a little
more energy than the amount of work we want to do. We use various types of
machines and engines in our day to day lives. It is seen always that energy is
wasted due to friction or some other causes. That is why almost always we need
to measure how efficiently a machine or engine is using energy. So, we use a


--- Page 126 ---
Work, Power, Energy 121
new quantity called efficiency. Efficiency can be expressed in percentage as:
_- __ amount of work __ amount of work —energy wasted
Efficiency = rT — Xx 100 = E——— xX 100
0) Example
Question: If an object of mass 10 kg is lifted 10 min 15 s using a motor of 1000
W, then what is the amount of wasted energy? What is its efficiency?
Answer:
Amount of work: 10 xX 9.8 x 10] = 9,800]
Energy given: 1000 x 15] = 15,000]
Energy wasted: 15,000 — 9,800 = 5,200
Effici = 800) X 100% = 65.3 %
iciency = 15,000] 0 = 653%
You will be surprised to know that, energy is wasted in every step of production
of electricity in a power plant, and if all these wastage is taken into account,
the efficiency of the power plant can drop down to 30%.
Question: If 10% energy is wasted in every step, what is the efficiency in
4 steps?
Answer: 0.9 0.9 x0.9 x0.9 = 0.6561
Or 65.6%

We are familiar with three states of matter- solids, liquids and gases. Among
them liquids and gases can flow so they are also called fluids. In this chapter we
will analyse and see how matter exerts pressure in its three states. Not only that,
elasticity is a special property of matter. We will also discuss how the property of
elasticity works in the solid, liquid and gaseous state.
Basides solid, liquid and gas, there is another state of matter named plasma, we

5.1 Pressure
Though we use the word ‘pressure’ in our everyday conversation in many ways,
the word has a definite meaning in physics. We have talked about applying many
kinds of forces at different times in the previous chapters. But how the force will
be applied was untold. For example you can push a stone with your one hand,
two hands or with your whole body (Fig. 5.01). Though you apply the same
amount of force every time, the pressure will be different. In the first case you
applied force through the area of your palm. If your applied force is F, area of
your palm is A then the pressure
p= F
TA
. oN
Unit of pressure: —= or Pa (Pascal)
Dimension of pressure [P] = ML™'T 2
Therefore, in the second case because of using two hands, the pressure will be
half as the area through which the force is being applied is doubled. In the third
case, you applied force through your whole body, so the area through which
force is applied will increase more and pressure will be decreased more.
Force is a vector, so you may think that pressure P is a vector! But the interesting
matter is pressure P is a scalar quantity and if we want to write it perfectly then
it should be written like as:
F=PA

130 Physics
Therefore, area itself is considered as a vector! A vector must have a magnitude
and the direction. The amount of area is the  magnitade of vector, the
perpendicular on the area is the direction of the vector.
Since pressure is a scalar quantity, it has no direction. It is so necessary, because
the concept of pressure is more important for a liquid and gas than the solid.
When liquids and gases apply pressure then actually it does not depend on the
direction. We will see this matter very soon.

Question: Let us assume your mass is 50 kg, area of one side of your body is 0.5
m?and bottom area of your two legs is 0.03 m?. What pressures will you apply on

You see less pressure is applied when you are lying down. For this reason when
one falls in quicksand he has to lie down so that the applied pressure becomes
lower and he does not submerge quicksand.
Again the opposite is also true, if the area of force applied is less, then the
pressure increases. The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when
the sharp point of the nail is placed on a wood or wall and hammered on the flat
back head of the nail, the force exerts pressure through the sharp point on the
wood or wall. As the area of sharp edge of the nail is just a point so pressure is
very high and the nail can easily penetrate the wood or wall. This is also true in ~~,
. . . a
the case of a knife. Its sharp edge is narrow, so it can apply more pressure and  &

it is possible to cut easily. Another name of the unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa),
when 1 N force is applied on an area of 1 m®> we get 1 Pa (1 Pascal) pressure.
5.2 Density
We need to have a clear idea about density before understanding pressure of
liquids and gases. Density is the amount of mass per unit volume, i.e. if mass of
a body is m and volume is 7, then density is:
om
EY
. . Table 5.01: Density of s subst:
Unit of density: kg/m* or gm/cc we ensity of some substances
Dimension of density: [P] = ML™® substances density
(gm/cc)
Density of some familiar substances is
given in table 5.01. Here is a good thing
to remember, if temperature increases
or decreases, volume of a substance can Human body
be increased or decreased. Since there is
no change in the mass, the density of
substance may change with
temperature. For this when we talk
about density of a substance, usually we
need to mention the temperature at
which the density is measured.

Therefore, density of Dead sea water,

or 0.81 liter
Example: What is the density of the nucleus? What is the mass of 1 tea
spoonful of nucleus?
Nucleus consists of neutrons and protons. The mass of one of them is 1.67 x 10727 kg,
Their approximate radius is 1.25 fm = 1.25 x 1075 m . Therefore, if we can
calculate the density of neutron or proton, it can be considered as the density of
the nucleus!
m 1.67 x 10727 kg 18 3
Density of nucleus, p= Fr ve 0.204 x 10'® kg/m"
zr? 3 (125x107 m)?
You need to guess how big this number is! One tea spoon contains
approximately 1 cc materials.
Therefore, mass of 1 tea spoon nucleus is:
m = 0.204 x 10*® kg/m*® x 107° m® = 2 x 10! kg
It is roughly the collective mass of all the people of the world. gd


--- Page 138 ---
State of Matter and Pressure 133
We can see it in another way. An atom has neutron-proton in its nucleus,
electrons remain outside. Mass of an electron is 1800 times less than the mass of
neutron-proton. Therefore mass of an atom is really the mass of its nucleus. It
does not matter too much electrons are not considered. But the things we see
around us, their shapes are not the volume of the nucleuses. Volume of the
substances come from the volume of their atoms. Electrons revolve around the
very tiny nucleus comparatively in a bigger orbit. Radius of an atom is nearly
1,00,000 times bigger than that of a nucleus.
Therefore, we can say in another way, if we can gather all the people of this world
and can create pressure to extract all nucleuses by breaking the atoms present in
their body and then if we put them together, these will be confined in a tea spoon.
5.2.1 Uses of Density in our Daily life
Density plays a vital role in our daily life. Sometimes we do not notice it
separately. For example, when we take water in a pot and hit it, after a while the
water starts to boil. It happens because when the water in the lower portion of the
pot becomes heated and expands, then its density decreases. As the density
becomes less, that water goes up and the cold water in the neighborhood comes
down. After some time this water also becomes heated and goes up and so within
a short period of time the water starts to boil. (The process of heating gas or
liquid in this way is called convection.) If density of water was not reduced after
heating, then it would not go up and we could only heat the water in the lower
part of the pot, by fire of the stove, and it would not be possible to heat the whole
water of the pot.
In intense sunshine in summer, those who have jumped into a pond have surely
noticed that though the surface water is hot but the bottom water is cold. Here
the heat comes from above and after heating, the top water density decreases and
remains above, the whole water of the pond can not be heated uniformly.
‘We have seen the balloons flying at the inauguration of various events. In order
to make balloons fly we need to insert gases lighter than air. Considering safety
they should be filled with inert helium gas, but helium gas is comparatively
expensive; so frequently it is done with hydrogen gas which is very dangerous.
& Not only that, as methane gas is lighter than air, which is used as a fuel is

sometimes used also to fill the balloons, which is similarly dangerous!
We have often seen air balloons. Fires are lit under the balloons, which heat the
air inside and make it lighter and this helps lift the balloon up.
We can determine whether the eggs are good or rotten by submerging them in
water. If the eggs have gone bad their density becomes lower than that of water
and they start to float.
5.3 Pressure in liquids
Those who have jumped in water, they all know, after going into deep water a
pressure is felt. (Though atmosphere applies a pressure on us but we don’t feel
it, because our body also applies the same pressure.) Exactly what amount of
pressure will be felt after going in deep water or any other fluid is already been
mentioned. The pressure on you will have to be calculated from the weight of the
column of liquid on you. Let us suppose that you want to determine the pressure
of the liquid at depth A. Imagine an area A there (Figure 5.02). The weight of the
column of liquid above this area will exert a force on 4.
Volume of the liquid over a surface area
A is Ah. If the density of the liquid is p gre

Density can be increased by compressing air or gas by increasing pressure but same
is not true for liquids (neither for solids !). Liquids cannot be compressed in the
same way with pressure, so its density cannot be increased or decreased. How
pressure of water is increases when we go from the surface to the bottom of a sea
is shown in figure 5.03. Since the density of water is nearly uniform, the
pressure is increasing at the same rate. Starting from zero at the surface of the
sea, it is increased a lot at the bottom of the sea.

Answer: For kerosene,

P =0.50m x 800 kgm x 9.8 Nkg! = 3,920 Nm?
For water,

P =0.50m x 1000 kgm? x 9.8 Nkg! = 4,900 N m?
For mercury,

P =0.50m x 13,600 kgm? x 9.8 Nkg'! = 666,40N m?
Question: At what depth of the liquids kerosene, water and mercury pressure
will be 1 atm ?
Answer: We know, for mercury pressure is latm at a depth of 76 cm. Density
of water is 13.6 times less than mercury, therefore depth of water will be 13.6
times more.
Therefore, depth for water: 76 cm x 13.6 = 1034 cm = 10.34 m
Density of kerosene is 0.8 times less than water, therefore depth for kerosene
will be 1/0.8=1.25 times more.
Therefore, depth for kerosene: 10.34 m x 1.25 = 12.92 m

5.3.1 Archimedes principle and
It is sure all of you know =F
Archimedes principle and the story [AY ass 4
behind this. The principle is easy, SUR:
‘If a body is immersed in a liquid, a g
the weight of the body is reduced by [—— 4
an amount equal to the displaced Ig i
liquid’. Now we "ll find this principle. A
A cylinder is immersed in some
amount of liquid is shown in figure
5.04 (This can be any object of any
shape, but for convenience of
calculation we took a cylinder). Let
us suppose that the height of the Figure 5.04: The weight of a body is
cylinder is /, cross-sectional area of reduced by an amount equal to the weight
top and bottom of the cylinder is 4. of the displaced water.
We imagine that the cylinder is
immersed in such a way that the depth of upper surface is /, and depth of lower
surface is /2,.
‘We have said many times that, pressure in a liquid (or gaseous) does not work in
a definite direction. It works in all directions. Therefore the downward pressure
acting on the upper surface of the cylinder is:

Py = hipg
and the upward pressure acting on lower surface is:

Py =hypg
Therefore, the downward force acting on upper surface and upward force acting
on lower surface are respectively:

Fy, = AP, = Ah, pg
F, = AP, = Ah, pg

We do not have to think about how much force is exerted on the surrounding
surface, because the force experienced by the cylinder from one direction is
equal and opposite to the force from another direction and neutralize one anoth-
er.
Forma-18, Physics, Class 9-10


--- Page 143 ---
138 Physics
As the value of 4, is greater than %,, so we see the value of F), is greater than
F,.
Therefore the resultant force will be upwards and its value will be:
F=F,—F =A; —h)pg
F = Ahpg

As 4h is the volume of the cylinder, pis the density of the liquid and g is
gravitational acceleration, therefore the force exerted upwards is equal to the
weight of the liquid which has the same volume as the cylinder. This is precisely
known as the Archimedes principle. The upwards force is called buoyancy.
@ Do Yourself

Tie a big size potato or a fruit at one end of a rubber band and hang it,

see how it is elongated. Now let the potato or the fruit be immersed into

water, you will see the rubber band is compressed slightly. Because in the

immersed condition the weight of the potato or fruit is less!
5.3.2: Floatation and Immersion of a Body
You have surely understood why an object floats and why an other object is
immersed. You know an object experiences an upward force due to buoyancy
which is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the object when it is
immersed in water. The object will float if that force is greater than the weight of
the object.
Just the portion of the object which is immersed so that it will displace water
equal to the weight of the body, only that portion will be immersed exactly, the
remaining part will not be immersed in water.
If the weight of the body is greater than the weight of the displaced water the
body will sink in water. But it seems that the weight of the body when immersed
is less than its real weight.
If the weight of displaced water can be made just equal to the weight of the
object anyway, then the object remains there where it is put in water, it will not
float above or even sink below. In our everyday life though it is not seen by us
but for the movement of the submarine under water this is done. 3

5.3.4 Pascal’s Law
We have shown many times in this chapter that if pressure is applied on a liquid,
it is transmitted towards all directions. You will understand that it is normal if
you think a bit. Because if the pressure is not transmitted into the whole liquid
then the pressure experienced in one part will be more and it will be less in
another part. Therefore if we imagine a cross sectional area then force applied
from one direction will be more than the force from an other direction and due
to this force the liquid will flow until the pressure becomes equal. Pascal
expressed this in the form of a law, that is stated below:
Pascal’s Law: If pressure is applied on a liquid or a gas enclosed in a
container from outside, then this pressure is transmitted equally and acts
perpendicularly on the surface of the container in contact with the liquid or
gas.


--- Page 146 ---
State of Matter and Pressure 141
Applications of Pascal’s Law:
Using Pascal’s law some interesting machines can be fabricated. In figure 5.05 a
machine like that is shown. Here two cylinders are connected by a pipe. Let’s
suppose cross sectional area of one cylinder is 4, and that of another cylinder 4,
, and you have applied force /7, on the cylinder of cross sectional area 4, Then
your applied pressure is
p=
Ay
Now this pressure is transmitted through the liquid in all directions and it will
also be applied on the cross sectional area of the second cylinder.
Therefore the amount of force applied on the second cylinder will be

Therefore, you see amazingly that if the magnitude of (4,/4)) is 100 then you
will get 100 times more force on the second cylinder than the force you
applied on the first cylinder!
This process is very effective and used to control very large factories and
aircrafts. But keep in mind; it is the principle of increasing forces. In this
process energy cannot be increased atl. You will ge t back the same amount
of energy on the second cylinder that you have applied on the first cylinder.

5.4 Air Pressure
Air has a certain pressure (Figure: 5.06). We do not feel this pressure distinctly
because a pressure is also exerted outside from inside of our bodies. So these two
pressures neutralize one another. There is no air in space, so there is no pressure
of air, so there is nothing to neutralize the inner pressure of our body and in such
an environment human bodies may explode instantly due to this inner pressure.
For this reason the astronauts always wear pressure protected space suits. The
pressure on the earth surface is 10°N/m?, which means if you imagine an area of
Im? on the earth surface, then the weight of the column of air on it is 10°N, this
is approximately the weight of an elephant !
Here, you have to understand something very clearly. It is true, weight is a force
and this force acts downwards. Force is a vector, so it has both magnitude and
direction. Pressure is not a vector, it has no
direction, so it is same in all directions at any
place. The place where you are standing or sitting
now, the pressure which air exerts on you is the Air coli
same in left , right , up, down or in all directions. <>
It is true for air or liquid for all times.
If an air-tight casket made of thin tin or
aluminum can be made airless in any way, then it
will be folded or twisted, because in normal
condition, the outer air pressure was balanced by k 4
inner air pressure of the casket in turn. After Fam JA }
evacuating the inside air by pumping, there is Figure 5.06: The pressure
nothing inside to resist the outer air pressure. So = oC
the outer air pressure will twist the casket eight of the air column.
(figure 5.07).

144 Physics
You will observe that the casket will not be twisted only from the upper side, it
will be twisted from all directions. If the pressure comes only from the upper
side the casket will be twisted only from the upper side. As the pressure is same
in all directions, so it comes from all directions, and the casket is twisted from
all directions.

The pressure on the surface of the earth originates from the weight of the air
column. So if we rise above then the height of the air column above us will
decrease, the weight will also decrease, due to this the air pressure will also
decrease there. The matter is true and how this air pressure decreases with height
is shown in Figure 5.09. What you have to observe separately is that the air
pressure has decreased by half after reaching a height of five kilometer.
Generally, one may ask by reduction of pressure why does it not become zero
after the next five kilometer? There is a specific reason behind it. Air or gas can
be compressed by putting a pressure. So on the surface of the earth, air becomes
most compressed where the air pressure is maximum i.e. the density of air is
maximum there. As we go above, the pressure of air will reduce, density of air
will decrease as well.

There are many practical aspects of reducing density of the air with height.
When a plane flies in the

sky, the friction of air acts

decreased further. The Figure 5.09: Air pressure reduces with height.
reason is that the planes

need powerful engines to fly and oxygen is required to burn the fuel of those
engines. The amount of oxygen is less where the density of air is less as at great
heights. So at higher altitudes the engine of the plane will not work due to the
shortage of oxygen.

Those who climb to the peak of mountains face the same problem. The higher
they climb the problem of less oxygen due to reducing density of air is more than
the problem of less air pressure. For this reason those who climb mountains have
to practice not only how to survive in less oxygen but also have to learn how to

of the pressure of air at the earth’s surface. Therefore the amount of oxygen
there is approximately 1/3 of the oxygen on the earth surface.
5.4.1: Experiment of Torricelli
You have surely had cold drinks with straws. Have you ever thought how the
cold drinks reaches your mouth when you sip? Really this occurs due to the
pressure of the air. It would be very easy to understand if you try to drink the
cold drinks with a 10.5 meter long straw. (This is not realistic at all. But
acknowledge it for the sake of argument!) Then you would discover that the
drinks rise 10.3 meter and stop suddenly. No matter how much you try the drinks
do not rise any more. (We are assuming that the density of cold drinks is close to
the density of water!)
Mercury is not a liquid to take into mouth but for the sake of argument imagine
you try to sip it to get it in your mouth with a straw. If the straw is longer than 76
cm, you will discover that the mercury has stopped just after rising 76 cm.
You try to sip the mercury does not rise any more! Density of mercury is 13.6
times more than the density of water, so elevated levels of more but the mercury
is 13.6 times lesser than the water.
Cold drinks will not rise up through a straw normally if we take a straw in the
mouth and put it into the bottle. Because the air pressure within your mouth is
the same as the air pressure of the liquid in which the straw is immersed. The two
pressures are equal so there is no effective force inside it. Now if you sip, which
means you try to create a vacancy in your mouth, then the air pressure becomes
low there. Then the liquid comes above through the straw due to the air pressure ig
on the liquid surface. N

Scientist Torricelli did this experiment of the pressure of air using mercury in the

year 1643. He did not try to make the mercury rise with a straw by mouth. He

filled a one ended tube with mercury and he put it in a mercury filled container

in an inverted way. After falling

continuously the mercury stopped at a height

of 76 cm. The vacancy which you try to !

create while sipping liquid, this vacancy was i

created in the upper portion of the glass tube. !

Air is exerting pressure on the mercury and |

that pressure being transmitted everywhere |

of the liquid, even down the tube. There is no |

leakage above the tube, so air cannot exert 76.cm

pressure through that side. Therefore to i

equalize the pressure there is only a pressure |

under the tube, which is the pressure due to |

the weight of 76 cm mercury column! :

The instrument by which air pressure is —_

measured is called a barometer (Figure:

5.10) and till now the pressure of the air is

measured by a barometer which uses the Figure 5.10: Mercury

process of Torricelli. The height of the becomes stationary just at 76

mercury column becomes more than 76 cm if cm height due to air pressure.

the air pressure increases and if pressure decreases the height become less than

76 cm.

5.4.2 Air Pressure and Weather

Weather has a close relationship with air pressure. You have certainly heard

many times in weather news about the creation of depression in the sea, which

means air pressure has been decreased there. Then air starts to come from the

nearby areas of high pressure to the low pressure area and sometimes a spin is

created, in special situation that spin creates cyclone. You certainly know the

news of horrible cyclones in our country.

‘When you will read about heat and temperature in the next chapter, you will

know that if the temperature of air is increased, then it expands, as a result
8 density and pressure decrease. Air pressure decreases more effectively if the

148 Physics
amount of vapor inside it increases. Vapor is water, in a molecule of water there
is an oxygen and two hydrogen atom and molecular mass of water is
(16+1+1=) 18. The main element of air is nitrogen (atomic mass 14), being
created by two atoms it’s molecular mass is (14+14=) 28 and oxygen (molecu-
lar weight 16), is also created by two atoms, so, it’s molecular mass is (16+16=)
32, which is much more than the molecular mass of water. So, when there is
vapor in the air, water of less molecular mass takes the place of nitrogen and
oxygen of higher molecular mass and so the density of air decreases. If the
density of air decreases, the air pressure also decreases. So, it is possible to
predict about the local weather seeing the air pressure on a barometer. If the
barometer shows high pressure then it is understood that the air is dry and the
weather is good. If the pressure starts to decrease then it is understood that the
quantity of vapor is increasing. If pressure low then air from the nearby areas
will come quickly and storm and rain will start.
5.5 Elasticity
All of you must have, one time or another, elongated a spring or a rubber band
by pulling on it and then releasing it. You have certainly noticed that after
releasing the spring or the rubber band it regains its previous length. In physics,
pulling is termed as ‘applying force’ and the change of the length is termed as
‘deformation’. The word deformation is taken negatively in our daily life. But
you should not take it negatively here. It is just a change in condition!
Therefore, you understand that when a force is applied to an object, a
deformation happens inside it (and for this deformation, a counter force is
created). If the force is withdrawn, deformation stops and the object comes back
to its initial condition. This property of a substance is called elasticity. But it
should be remembered that the quantity of the applied force has a limit. If the
limit is crossed, the substance will not be able to come back to its initial
condition. A permanent deformation could take place. This limit is termed as the
elastic limit. After bending a rod slightly, if it is released then it becomes straight.
If it is bent too much then it remains curved and does not become straight.
Therefore we can state this like:
Strain: The relative change in length or shape which is made by applying a force
from outside is called strain. Therefore, if force is applied on an object of
length L , and the changed length becomes L then it’s strain is: L — Lo BS
Lo


--- Page 154 ---
State of Matter and Pressure 149
It is seen that the deformation has no
unit, it is only a number. a
Stress: The force per unit area that |
develops within a substance due to L.
deformation is called stress. 1 L
If a force is applied on a body of cross T
sectional area 4 and as a result
deformation occurs, then if this
deformation develops a resistive force
F, then stress is: yo
Li lv
A
You see it is similar to pressure and its Figure 5.11: Deformation occurs in
unit is Pa or Pascal. a bar if stress is created by applied
force.

Hooke’s law: If we have understood stress and strain, it is easy to

understand Hooke’s law. According to this law, ‘within elastic limits stress

is directly proportional to strain’.

stress o strain
Therefore,
Stress = constant x Strain.
That is, there is a constant relating stress to strain for each material; the name of
this constant is modulus of elasticity.
It will be easy to understand if we discuss two things:
i) Let us suppose that the length of a wire of cross-sectional area Ais , ,
a body of weight 7 is hanged from it and due to this hanged force the wire is
elongated from LZ, to L (Figure 5.11). This elongated length creates a counter
force T in the wire (Here the letter 7 is used to mean the word ‘tension’.
Generally, when a wire is pulled then the force acting in it is named as tension).
.. Therefore Stress is 7/4 and strainis L — Lo

5.6 Three States of Matter: Solid, Liquid and Gas
You certainly know that, everything of the universe is made of molecules!
(In fact, molecules are not fundamental particles, molecules consist of atoms,
atom consists of electros and nucleus, nucleus consists of protons and neutrons,
proton and neutron consists of quarks and the scientists are assuming that
electrons or quarks are made of strings!). Since, the properties of a matter exist
in molecules, molecules are considered the smallest unit of matter. For example,
all properties of water exist in a water molecule, but when it is split into atoms it
does not exist as water. There will be one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, both
" in the gas form. Whether the substance is solid, liquid or gas depends on how
S$ molecules are arranged within the matter (Figure: 5.13). The most

familiar example of it is water; it can exist in three states, e.g. solid, liquid and
gas. Whether it is ice, water or vapor depends on how the molecules are within
it.
When a substance remains in the gaseous state, then its molecules are free, the
distance between one another is very large. When the substance is in a liquid
state, then though the molecule remains comparatively closer but they can move
with respect to one another. In solid state, molecules remain the closest, but can
not move with respect to the other.

The distance among the molecules of a gas are very large. Those substances have
no regular volume and shape. Molecules in a liquid remains closer and they have
a particular volume but no regular shape. In a solid, molecules are very close and
they are almost in contact with each other, so they have a definite volume and a
regular shape.
In a gas, molecule can move freely, in liquids the molecules vibrate, and one can
pass through from one side to the other, in solids though the molecules can
vibrate but they can not change their position.
Normally we cannot see the molecules of solids, liquids or gases, we see it as
solid, liquid or gas. The properties of molecules which have been mentioned
above, are exhibited in their solid, liquid or gaseous state too.

5.6.1 Molecular Kinetic Theory of Matter
If a solid substance is kept on a table, the solid exerts a kind of pressure on the table, on
the area of the table which it touches. If we want to put some liquid on the table instead
of solid, it will not work; the liquid will spread over the table. Liquids have to be
contained in a pot and the liquid exerts pressure not only on the bottom of the container
but it exerts pressure on the walls of the container in all directions. (If a hole is created in
the wall of the container, the liquid will come out through this hole due to the pressure of
liquid.) If we want to put gas then it is not possible to put it in a open container, then it is
to be stored in a bound region and the gas will exert pressure on the bound surface in all
directions. Gas is contained in a balloon. If we make a hole on a balloon, air will come
out through this hole due to the air pressure.

@ Do Yourself

Put a piece of scotch tap on an air filled balloon. Now make a hole on the

balloon through the scotch tap with a needle. You will see that the balloon

does not burst but air is coming out.
We mentioned about pressure of gas but didn’t explain its reason. We can
explain the reason of pressure by the molecular kinetic theory. If a gas is kept in
a closed space then it puts a pressure on the walls of the container, this can be
explained with the help of the molecular kinetic theory of substance. In a closed
region the molecules of a gas starts moving randomly and every time it hits the
walls of the container it goes back due to reflection. Therefore a gas molecule
hits the wall with a particular momentum, and returns back with a different
momentum. You know to change the momentum of an object; a force has to be
applied on that object. Hitting the wall, the gas molecules apply a force on the
wall. According to Newton’s third law, the wall also applies a counter force on
the molecule thus reflecting the molecule.
An enormous number of molecules thus hit the walls of the container and this
combined force appears as the pressure of the gas.If the temperature of the gas is
increased, then the kinetic energies of the molecules will increase and the
molecules will hit the wall harder. This means the pressure will be increased.
We will see in the next chapter that due to the application of heat, temperature
increases and as a result pressure also increases.
5.6.2 Fourth State of Substance
Despite solids, liquids and gases, the three different sates of matter, substances
may have a fourth state named plasma. We know the number of the positively
charged protons in the nucleus of a molecule or an atom is equal to the number
of negatively charged electrons outside it. That’s why the combined charge of a
molecule or atom is zero. Under special conditions a molecule or an atom can be
ionized, one or more electrons of some atoms can be made free, then separately
the atoms do not remain charge neutral. A kind of a mixture of ions and electrons
is made. Though it stays like a gas but all of the properties of gas are not true for
it. Like we know, a gas has no fixed shape but a fixed shape of plasma canbe ~~ &
made by a magnetic field. o


--- Page 160 ---
State of Matter and Pressure 155
Gases can be turned into plasma by giving excessive heat; plasma also be made
by a powerful electric field. In our house, plasma is created in a tube light. There
is also plasma in the luminous advertisement of neon light. The light which is
seen during thunder is also plasma and the substances which remain in the far
stars is also in the plasma state. At present, we use nuclear energy in fission
process by breaking a heavy nucleus. We try to use plasma for creating energy in
fusion process combining the light nucleuses and now this is a very important
field of research in physics.

Heat is a kind of energy. From the concept of energy we may think that heat
flows always from higher heat energy to lower heat energy, but it is not true. In
which direction heat will flow, depends on the temperature. In this chapter we
will see how we can measure heat or temperature and what is the relation
between them.
Actually heat energy comes from the motion of molecules, atoms or their
vibrations. If the vibration of molecules of any solid object is increased to a great
extent, then molecules may go far from another one, that is, a change of state
may occur. In this chapter we will discuss the effect of heat on solids, liquids and “-
gases. s

6.1 Heat and Temperature:
Heat is a kind of energy. We have seen that energy can do work. By applying
force it is possible to displace a body in the direction of the force, for example
heat is produced by burning fuel oil in a train or a car and this produced energy
creates motion in the train or car. So this new form of energy is called heat
energy like light, electricity or kinetic energy.
It is interesting that if we could see on the molecular level i.e., looking at any
substance if we see its molecules, we should call it "kinetic energy" instead of
the "heat energy". Because what we mean by heat energy is actually nothing but
the combined kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance. When the
molecules of a solid are heated then the molecules vibrate about their fixed
positions. The more the molecules are heated, the more the vibration increases.
If the molecules are heated enough the molecules become free by overcoming
the intermolecular forces among them. Then we call it a liquid. Then the
molecules move randomly among themselves. Since the molecules are in
motion, they have kinetic energy. The more the molecules are heated, the faster
they will move. If the molecules are heated more, they may be completely free
from their intermolecular forces. Then we call it a gas. The more a gas will be
heated, the faster its molecules will move. The more the velocity, the more the
kinetic energy.
Since we cannot see the molecules with our naked eyes, we cannot see their
movement, so we try to understand the whole thing indirectly, we call it heat
energy and try to explain the states of matter considering it as temperature. So
we can say that the energy which is obtained due to molecular vibration or
motion of a substance is called heat. As it is a form of energy like other energy,
so its unit is Joule (J). There is another unit of heat which is calorie (cal). The
amount of heat energy required to increase the temperature of 1 gm of water by
1° C is called 1 Calorie. 1 Calorie is equal to 4.2 J. You have heard about the
word “calorie” which is used in case of food. Food Calorie means actually the
amount of energy obtained from a definite quantity of food and the unit for this
is kcal or 1000 calorie. But we will not worry about this now. Here we will
discuss heat energy not energy gained from foods. 5

Effect of Heat on Matter 163

6.1.1 Internal Energy

If we accept heat as energy, the next thing we need to know how heat energy is

transferred from one place to another. Generally we think that energy always

flows from higher energy to lower energy. The amount of heat energy that is

contained in a glass of water is much more than that of a small hot pin. But if we

put the hot pin into the water, a small amount of the energy of the pin will

transfer to the water of the glass. Because of this, the flow of heat energy does

not depend on the amount of heat, it depends on the temperature. If two bodies

of different temperatures come in contact with each other, always heat transfers

from the body of higher temperature to

the body of lower temperature until the

temperature of the two bodies becomes

equal.

But we have not yet defined the

quantity called “temperature” yet. But

it is used so much in daily life that

nobody faces problems in YO

understanding ~~ what temperature SIs oo=

means. According to physics we can = EE====saa

say that it is the measure of average ye TIZTZIIIEE

kinetic energy of the molecules of ; ] ;

matter. From our experience we can Figure 6.01: Temperature is as like

say that temperature is the thermal pe height orate and heatis as

state which indicates whether an object ike the volume of liquid

absorbs or rejects heat when it comes in contact with another object. To

understand this, we can compare it with the height of the surface of water in

(Figure 6.01).

If the heights of the upper surface of water in the two containers are different,

and they are connected with a pipe, the flow of water will not be determined by

which container contains more or less water. Water flow will depend on the

height of the upper surface of water of the containers. Always water will flow

from higher height to lower height until the two heights become equal. Here we

can compare the amount of water with heat energy and the height of the surface
.. of water with temperature. It is also true in case of temperature that the heat
S flows until the temperature of the two objects becomes the same.

6.2 Thermal Properties of matter

To measure the temperature special properties of special substances are used.
The property of a substance which changes with temperature and, measuring the
change accurately, the temperature can be measured, is called thermometric
property. The property of a substance which is used to measure the temperature
is called thermometric property. You have seen mercury thermometer that
measures our body temperature. Here mercury is the thermometric substance,
the volume expansion of mercury is its thermometric property.

There is also an alcohol thermometer except mercury thermometer in which
alcohol is the thermometric substance and the expansion of alcohol is the
thermometric property. In a gas thermometer, gas is the thermometric substance
and the pressure of the gas at constant volume is the thermometric property. As
the resistance of metal changes with temperature, so the resistance also is used
as the thermometric property. Different thermometric substances are effective at
different temperatures, so to measure the very high or very low temperature the
special thermometric property of a special thermometric substance has to be
used. Copper and Constantan metals are used as thermometric substances. If two
junctions of different metals (thermocouple) are kept at different temperatures,
it produces anemf and by measuring this, the temperature can be calculated. This
thermocouple is used in industries on a large scale because it can measure the
temperature from -200°C to 1000°C.

If we get the idea of temperature perfectly, we have to know its unit in
addition to, the important question of how we will measure the temperature. The
conventional unit of temperature is Celsius (°C), generally it is said that on this
scale at one atmospheric pressure and at the temperature at which ice melts is
called 0°C and at the temperature at which water boils is assumed to be 100°C.
But it is interesting to know that when scientist Celsius introduced this scale of
temperature, he assumed the temperature of boiling water as zero degree and the
temperature of fusion of ice as 100 degree; opposite to the present scale!
Although we use the Celsius scale of temperature in our daily lives, its
international unit is Kelvin (K). Adding 273.15°C with the reading of Celsius
scale we get the reading of Kelvin scale. If we consider only the difference of
temperature, there is no difference between Celsius and Kelvin scale. That is, the
increase in temperature by 10 °C is the same as the increase in temperature by BS

30 °C, but in Kelvin scale it will be (30+273.15) =303.15 K. You may think that
the two scales are completely same but the difference between the readings of
the two scales is 273.15 °C, what is the reason behind this? The reason behind
this is very wonderful. Generally, we may think that we can imagine any

Fahrenheit scales of temperature In other words it is said that the Kelvin
scale has been made considering the
absolute zero temperature as zero Kelvin.
To make any scale of temperature two certain temperatures (or fixed points) are
needed. In the Kelvin scale one is absolute zero which is taken as zero degree.
Another one is the triple point of water. At this temperature and at a certain
pressure (0.0060373 atm) ice, water and water vapour can exist together, so this
temperature can be defined very accurately. In the Celsius scale its value is 0.01
°C and to make the similarity with Celsius scale its value is 273.16° in Kelvin
scale.
Besides, the Kelvin and Celsius scales there is an another scale called the
Fahrenheit scale in which the temperature of fusion of ice and vaporization of
water are 32°F and 212°F respectively. In the figure 6.02 three scales are shown
for comparison, where 0 °C is equal to the temperature 273.15 K, sometimes
no We take this as 273 K in our daily lives. This does not cause a major problem in

6.3 Thermal Expansion of Matter

6.3.1 Expansion of Solids:

Volume of almost all objects increases to some extent if they are heated. It is not

difficult to understand the cause of heat and temperature if we explain them with

the help of an atomic model. We can imagine a solid as a collection of many

molecules. We can compare the molecular forces among them with a spring. We

have imagined a spring among molecules to show how molecules are arranged

in a solid as shown in figure 6.03. When the solid is heated, its molecules will
», vibrate. The higher the temperature, the more the molecules will vibrate. We

& have to improve this spring model to some extent to explain the real nature of

168 Physics
solids. We have seen in case of a spring that the force by which it is pulled when
it is expanded to a certain distance, it pushes by the same force when it is
compressed by the same amount. This is not true completely for the molecules
of a solid. The amount of force by which molecules pull each other when they
are moved away to a certain distance they push themselves by much more force
when they are brought close to each other by the same distance. That is, this
spring is a special type of spring. Less force is applied to expand but more
force is applied to compress it.

Now imagine that the molecules are <r,

away slightly from one another. When all molecules will move away from one
another, the whole solid seems to be expanded slightly.

Length, breadth and height of a solid are expand equally in three directions by
the application of heat. To analyze this expansion three quantities named
co-efficient of linear expansion, co-efficient of area expansion and co-efficient
of volume have been introduced.

You have seen from the above examples that actually the value of the co-
efficient of expansion of solids is very small. For this reason, the three different
co-efficients a, p and ¥ were not necessary. For working we could explain the
co-efficient of linear expansion only. For example let us assume the matter of
area expansion.
We see:
Ay = Ay + BAT, — T1)
But area 4 is the product of length and width and if we consider the area of a
square whose length is L , then its area, after increasing the temperature, will be
A; = 13 = [Ly + aly (T, = TD]?
Or Ap = 13 + 20L3(T, = Ty) + o2L3(T, = Ty)?
But A, =13
So, Ay = Ay + 204,(T, — Ty) + 0A, (T, — T;)?
We have seen that the value of a is very small, so the value of o? is smaller. In
fact it is so small that if we avoid the whole part with ¢?, then no problem will
arise in our analysis or calculation. So we can write:
Ay = Ay + 204,(T, — Ty)
But we know,
Ay = Ay + A(T, — Ty) a
S


--- Page 176 ---
Effect of Heat on Matter 171
Certainly we can write:
Similarly we can assume a cube of L length, width and height. Its volume at
temperature 7, is | and the volume becomes 7, after increasing the temperature
to T,, so we have

Vy = [Ly + aly (T, = TD?
According to the same argument, also here if we avoid the parts with o* and o,
then no problem will arise in our analysis or calculation. So only the first two
terms will be present, i.e.

V, = 13 +3al3(T, — Ty)...
But we know Vv, =13
That is , Vy = Vy + 3aVy(T, = Ty)
So, Vo =Vi +i (T, = Ty)
Certainly we can write
In our practical life we have to keep in mind the issue of expansion of solids. You
have seen the gap between the rails of rail tracks. This has been done taking
thermal expansion into consideration. If no space was left for expansion, the rail
lines would bend. Cavities develop in teeth due to lack of regular brushing. The
dentist fills these cavities with a special type of substance. The co-efficient of
expansion of the substance has been made very carefully which is equal to that
of the teeth. If the co-efficient of expansion were less than that of teeth, it would
come out from the cavity while eating something hot! Again, if the co-efficient
of expansion of the substance were greater, it would come out from the cavity of
the tooth while eating something cold! Many of the general people know the
matter of thermal expansion without studying physics. You will notice that when
the cork of a bottle is stuck, hot water is poured on it so that the cork becomes

a loose after expansion of the bottle.

6.3.2. Expansion of liquid
Liquids have no length or area. Liquids have only volume. So the expansion of
a liquid means its volume expansion. While measuring the expansion of a
liquid, we have to be alert, because a liquid is kept in a container. To measure the a
co-efficient of expansion when the liquid is heated, the container which is also S


--- Page 178 ---
Effect of Heat on Matter 173
heated needs to be considered. So the expansion of a liquid in a container
observed is not real expansion, it is an apparent expansion. Therefore, to
measure the real expansion, the expansion of the container must be kept in mind
always. Usually, the expansion of liquids is more z
than that of liquids. If it was not the case we could
not see the apparent expansion. It seems to be
apparent compression!
The most common example of the expansion of Ii
liquid is a thermometer. There are many types of f
thermometers, among them perhaps the clinical |
thermometer (Figure 6.05) is the most familiar.
A glass tube contains mercury at the bottom. If heat
is applied, the volume of mercury is increased and it «— Fine curve
goes up through the capillary tube. To what extent it «— Mercury
reaches is the measurement of the temperature.
While measuring the fever by a thermometer, it is to ~~ Figure 6.05 : Fine curve

curve is made at the bottom of the narrow tube. Due ~~ Mercury can not fall in

temperature. Mercury is brought down by shaking.
Real and Apparent Expansion
It has been said earlier that a liquid is always heated in a container. If heat is
applied, the expansion of the container occurrs along —
with the liquid. So the expansion of a container is kept ini Cc
in mind to measure the exact expansion of a liquid. Fl A
The expansion of a liquid, without considering the B B
expansion of the container, is called apparent
expansion. If the expansion of a liquid is measured
considering the expansion of the container, it is called
real expansion.
If a glass bulb with a long graduated stem is heated

the upper level of the liquid comes down to mark B Figure 6.06 : Real and

«application of heat the temperature of the bulb will
& increase before increasing the temperature of the


--- Page 179 ---
174 Physics
liquid, i.e., the bulb will expand a little bit.
After that if we continue applying heat, the height of the liquid will increase. As
the expansion of liquids is more than solids, we will observe that finally the level
of the liquid has reached mark C from B after passing the mark A.
If we multiply the height AB by the cross section of the tube, we will get the
expansion V, of the bulb. Again if we multiply the height B_. by the cross section,
we will get the real expansion V, of the liquid. Here the apparent expansion V,
is
Va=V= Vp
6.3.3 Expansion of Gases
A solid has both shape and volume, so no problem arises in understanding the
expansion of the solid. Though a liquid has no definite shape, it has a definite
volume. So, we can explain or measure its expansion. It is very interesting in the
case of gas. Because neither does it
have a definite shape nor a definite
volume. A gas takes the whole
volume of its container. If the same
amount of a gas is kept in containers
of different volumes, the pressures
of the gases will be different. So, we
0 can see that the increase of volume
H of a gas will be measured without
| changing its pressure as shown in the
figure 6.07. An object of definite

equal pressure to the gas contained
in the cylinder.
By applying pressure, liquids or solids cannot be compressed very much. But a
gas can be compressed very easily. Therefore, at first we have to know the
relation between the pressure and volume of a gas. It is called the ideal gas §


--- Page 180 ---
Effect of Heat on Matter 175
equation and it is:
PV =nRT
Here P is pressure, Vis volume, is the amount of gas (measured in mole), R is
a constant (8.314 JK" mol") and 7 is temperature in Kelvin scale.
Now we can find out the co-efficient of expansion of a gas. At a certain pressure
if the volume of a gas is V/, at temperature 7’ and the volume is V, at temperature
T, the co-efficient of volume expansion B of the gas will be:

: =7
Therefore, you can see that the co-efficients of expansion of gases are not
constants at all. It is reciprocal to the temperature (7), i.e., the less the
temperature is the more the expansion of solid will be! In other words, at a
definite pressure and a definite temperature the amount of expansion due to
increase of temperature by one degree is less than the expansion due to increase
- of temperature by one degree at the same pressure but at low temperature.

Take two balloons, put a small amount of water into one of them and air of
the same volume in another one. Now put the two balloons under hot water
for a small interval of time. You will notice that the balloon containing water
remains the same, because the expansion of liquid due to heat is smaller but
the balloons containing air has expanded in volume to a large extent,
because the expansion of gas is much more higher than that of liquid.
6.4 Effect of Temperature in Change of State
Already you have know that all solids consist of molecules and in solids
molecules attract one another from a certain position. If heat is applied, their
vibrations increase and the molecular bonds become weak. They start to move
rolling upon one another and we call it a liquid. If the temperature is increased
further, the molecules start to move freely. We called it a gas. Now we observe
this more deeply and we will be introduced to different quantities which are
related to the change of state of matter.
‘When heat is applied to a solid, its temperature goes up. (we will know later at
what rate the temperature will rise and on what factor it depends.)
If the temperature (at a definite pressure) reaches a definite value, the solid starts
to melt. This process is called fusion and the temperature at which the fusion
starts is called the melting point. If we continue to measure the temperature,
surprisingly we will notice that when fusion has started, the temperature of the
mixture of some amount of solid and some amount of liquid does not increase
any more even if heat is applied (as shown in the figure 6.08). During this time
the heat is used to loosen the intermolecular bonds of the molecules in the solid.
So, the temperature cannot rise because applied heat cannot make the
molecules move further. During fusion at a definite melting point the amount of
heat which is used to convert the whole solid into liquid, is called the Latent Heat
of Fusion.
3


--- Page 182 ---
Effect of Heat on Matter 177
On the solid being totally liquefied the temperature starts to increase again (as
shown in the figure 6.08). The temperature increases gradually and at one stage
the liquid starts to convert into gas. This process is called vaporization and the
temperature at which vaporization occurs is called the boiling point. Again,
everyone is being reminded that this boiling point depends upon pressure.
When the process of vaporization starts by absorbing the heat energy, the
molecules of the liquid start to become free from the molecular bonds among
themselves. Here also the temperature does not increase like fusion even if heat
is applied. During vaporization of liquid the amount of heat by which the whole
liquid is converted into a gas, that heat is called Latent Heat of Vaporization.

Time (s)
Figure 6.08 : Melting and boiling point does not change during heat.
After converting the whole liquid into a gas the temperature of the gas continues
to increase if heat is being applied. If the temperature is raised to
extremely high levels, the molecules will become ionized and a fourth state of
matter called plasma will start to form but this is something different.
All of us have seen at least one example of the process by which solids can be
converted into liquids and liquids into gases, that one is ice converted into water
and water into vapour. Although we do not see directly the latent heat of fusion
or latent heat of vaporization, but we have felt its effect. When we suddenly
come to an open place or in open air from a crowded or a closed place, then our
sweating body becomes cool. This is because during the vaporization of
sweat, the required latent heat of vaporization is absorbed from our body and our
body becomes cool. By applying heat solids can be converted into liquids and
liquids into gases, its reverse process also occurs. By extracting heat gas can be
Forma-23, Physics, Class 9-10


--- Page 183 ---
178 Physics
converted into liquids and liquids into solids. The process of converting a
gaseous substance from gaseous state to the liquid state is called liquification.
The process of converting a liquid substance from its liquid state to solid state is
called solidification.

During the change of state of matter, the transformation from solid to liquid and
from liquid to solid happens at a particular temperature. But without reaching
that particular temperature a substance can transform from solid to liquid, liquid
to gas or directly from solid to gas. It is not difficult to understand this if we go
back to the molecular model of a substance. If a molecule somehow gets
sufficient energy and due to this, its kinetic energy is increased sufficiently then
the molecule may come out from the surface of solid or liquid substance. Since
a large number of molecules from air are continuously striking the surface of
solid or liquid, so sometimes some of the molecules of solids or liquids may
obtain the required energy to become free. The more the surface area is, the
faster the process will be. All of us have seen this process e.g., a wet object dries
by itself. For this the temperature does not need to be at the boiling point. Drying
means the evaporation of the molecules of a liquid. This may happen at any
temperature and the process is called evaporation.

At the time of evaporation, water absorbs the latent heat of vaporization; the
reverse process is also true. If vapors transform into water by any process then it
delivers heat. During a cyclone the air filled with water vapour goes upwards,
when the vapor transforms into water the latent heat of vaporization is released
as energy. This energy acts as the source of the devastating energy of a cyclone.
Dependence of Vaporization

You have seen that wet clothes do not dry easily in the rainy season. On the other
hand in winter the clothes become dry naturally when they are kept inside the
house. After washing the clothes should be spread well for drying. If the wet
clothes are kept folded, they remain wet. The matter of drying of wet clothes is
nothing but the evaporation of water. So, you notice that the evaporation of
water depends on some factors. To speak the truth, what is true for water is also
true for other liquids. Therefore, we can make a list of the factors on which the
evaporation of liquids depends:

Flow of air: The rate of vaporization increases if the air flows faster over the
liquid.

The area of the exposed surface of the liquid: Evaporation increases as the
area of the exposed surface of the liquid increases. A glass of water takes quite S


--- Page 184 ---
Effect of Heat on Matter 179
some time to evaporate but the same amount of water poured into a plate
evaporate much faster.
Nature of liquid: The less the boiling point of a liquid, the higher would be the
rate of evaporation. The rate of evaporation of volatile liquids is a maximum.
Pressure of air: The lower the pressure of air, the more the rate of evaporation.
The rate of evaporation in vacuum is a maximum, so air is taken out to make dry
food with a pump for preservation of the food.
Temperature: If the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid increases,
the rate of evaporation will increase.
Dryness of air: The drier the air over the liquid surface is, the more the liquid
evaporates.
6.5 Specific Heat
Heat, temperature and the relation between them are discussed so far, however the
amount of heat needed to increase the temperature of an object has not been discussed
yet. You might have noticed that in order to heat some water, it needs to be kept
on the oven for a long time, but approximately the same amount of metal take
little time to be heated at the same temperature. This is because, the specific heat
of a metal is much less compared to water. The amount of heat required to
increase the temperature of a body of mass 1 kg by 1 K is called the specific heat.
That is, if an amount of heat Q is required to increase the temperature from 7’ to
T,, the specific heat will be:
_ Q
s=—0t
m(T, — Th)
Heat capacity C is the amount of heat required to increase the temperature 1K of
a body. The amount of heat required to increase the temperature 1K of a body of
mass 1 kg is called specific heat. So we can easily find out the heat capacity C of
a body if we know the specific heat of that substance. If the mass of an body is
., mand the specific heat is s, then the heat capacity will be:


--- Page 185 ---
180 Physics
C=ms
The heat capacity of 10 kg gold is
C=10x 230JK?! = 2300 JK?!
In comparison the heat capacity of 10 kg water is
C=10x 4200 JK! =42,000]JK" i.e. about 20 times more.

This means that gold or any other metal can be heated quickly but water cannot
be heated so easily.
6.6 Fundamental Principles of Calorimetry
In winter during a bath we often pour a little boiling water into a bucket of cold
water. The boiling water slowly become cold by giving up heat to the cold water.
The cold water of the bucket also slowly becomes hot by absorbing the heat
from the boiling water. Within a short time, all the water will get to a
comfortable temperature by decreasing the temperature of the boiling water and
increasing the temperature of the cold water. If we wish, we can find things like
the amount of heat lost or gained, and their final temperature when various
objects of various temperature are mixed together. To do so we just have to know
a few rules. They are:

(1) The body at higher temperature gives heat to the body at the lower

temperature until they reach thermal equilibrium.

(2) The amount of heat given up by the bodies at higher temperature will be

equal to the heat gained by the bodies at the lower temperature. (We assume

that no heat is lost in this process by any other means.)

Question: A piece of ice of mass 100 gm is dropped into water of 1 liter at

whole piece of ice? .

Effect of Heat on Matter 181
Answer: Let us assume the temperature of ice is 0 °C.
Mass of ice my; = 100 gm = 0.1 kg
Mass of liter water mp = 1kg
Specific heat of water s = 4.2 x 103 Jkg'K!
The water of 1kg has to supply the heat that is required to melt the piece of ice
and to raise the temperature of the ice melted water to its final temperature. Let
us consider the final temperature of water is 7, then the amount of heat absorbed
by the ice is:
Heat required to melt: m L
The heat required to increase the temperature from 0 °C to T after melting: m s(T-0)
The mass of water m, supplies these amounts of heat, so its temperature will
decrease.
That is,
The heat supplied: m,s(30° C—T)
These two types of heat must be equal. Hence:

heat the temperature of 2 liter water reaches T by increasing the temperature from

Mass of water m, = 1kg

Specific heat of irons; = 0.45 x 10° Jkg'K™

Specific heat of water 5, = 4.2 x 103 Jkg'K?!

The amount of heat given up by the piece of iron is equal to the heat gained by the

water. So, the temperature of iron T will be

6.7 Effect of Pressure on Melting Point and Boiling Point

If pressure is applied on a substance, its melting point goes down, for this reason

when pressure is applied, two pieces of ice unite together to form a single piece.

Where pressure is applied on an ice, the melting point decreases there and the ice

melts, after the removal of pressure the melting point again goes back to the previous

value. As a result the water obtained from the fusion of ice again freezes into ice.

Attaching two masses to the ends of a string, if it is placed upon the surface of an ice

bar so that the masses are hanging at the two ends; it will seem that the string has cut

the ice bar into two pieces. But examining the ice we will see that the ice is still a

single piece (Figure 6.09). -

Boiling point changes due to pressuse. Boiling point decreases if pressure is low,
boiling point increases if pressure is high. This is why those who go to big heights
while mountain climbing, they have to cook something for a long time because due
to low pressure water starts to boil at
comparatively low temperatures. As
temperature can not be increased, so it takes
a longer time to cook. Pressure cookers a A <4 g

7.1 Simple Harmonic Motion
By attaching a mass at the lower end of a spring if we release it after pulling, it
will move up-down (In chapter 3 and 4 we have explained this motion). We have
seen that due to friction or other means, energy is lost; and it stops after a while.
Otherwise, it would move up-down for an infinite time. We have also seen that
in simple harmonic motion, the energy of the mass attached to the spring
exchanges between kinetic energy and potential energy. We can assume that the
spring follows Hooke's law. Let’s recall the law: if the spring constant is k and
the position of the end of the spring is at a distance x from its equilibrium
position, then the restoring force Fof the spring is given by:
F = —kx
The harmonic or oscillatory motion that obeys Hooke’s law is called simple
harmonic motion. This is one of the most important motions in physics.

In your book, there is no scope of deducing it, but there is no harm in knowing
it.
If the spring constant of a spring is & and m is the attached mass, then the time
period of the mass is,

If instead of being a spring, it would be a pendulum and if the length of the
pendulum is / and gravitational acceleration is g, then the time period is:

(No, there is no mistake, whether you hang a light mass or a heavy mass,
the time period will be the same, it does not depend on the mass.)

Question : Hang a stone of mass 10 gm from a string 1 m long. What is its time
period? ; 1
Answer: T=2r|-=27|555s=20s

The time period remains the same whether the mass of the stone is 10 gm or not.
If you wish, by measuring the time period you can determine the value of g just
now. Try and see!
If a mass is attached to the lower end of a spring, the mass will extend the spring
and. This state of the spring is called the equilibrium condition (Figure 7.01-0).
Now we pull the mass downward by a short distance a and release it (Figure
7.01). Then the mass will moving upward, crossing the equilibrium condition, it
will move upward by a distance a. Then again it will be moving downward,
crossing the equilibrium condition, it will come down and this will continue.

Figure 7.01: (0) is equilibrium condition. After pulling at position (1), the spring is
oscillating in simple harmonic motion when it is released.
When the mass completes the positions 2 — 3 — 4 — 5 and comes to the
position (6) in the same way (moving upward with velocity v) from where it
g


--- Page 196 ---
Waves and Sound 191
started, then we say a complete oscillation has taken place. It has to be
remembered that completing 2 — 3 positions when the mass comes to the
position 4, it will come to the position from where it started, but it is not a
complete oscillation. Because at the first 2 position the mass moves upwards
and at the next 4 position it is moving downwards, therefore it did not come to
the same or initial position in the same manner.
To analyze the simple harmonic motion, it is better to explain some quantities.
The first may be the time period 7. The time required for one complete oscilla-
tion is called the time period. Frequency fis the number of complete oscillations
per second. Therefore, f = : . if time period is expressed in second, then unit of
f will be Hertz (Hz).
In simple harmonic motion, amplitude is the maximum upward (or downward)
distance. The maximum displacement is called amplitude. As shown in figure
7.01, here the amplitude is a.
The next term is phase. When the mass attached to the spring is moving up and
down, if we follow the mass at any instant, we will see that it will stay in a
certain position from the equilibrium; this position is its phase. In simple
harmonic motion this definite condition of the mass and the spring will return
identically just after one time period. In terms of physics, we can say in simple
harmonic motion the phase that develops at any instant, after one time period,
this phase returns again.
7.2 Waves
All of us have seen waves, when a stone is thrown into water then waves spread
out in all directions from that point. When a bulb is switched on in the room, the
light that spreads in the room is also a wave. When we talk, the sound that reach
from one place to another place is also a wave. When a compressed spring is
released, the deformation that propagates through it is a kind of a wave too. In
short, we can say, we can realize what a wave is. But what will we say if we want
to give a nice definition for it in terms of physics?

192 Physics
If the deviation or disturbance in a quantity changes position with time,
it is referred to as a wave. A single disturbance can constitute a wave,
while a series of repeated disturbances can also generate a wave; in this
context, it is called a wave train.Generally, the term 'wave' refers to peri-
odic wave trains, while single disturbances are less commonly referred
to by this term.

Some waves require a medium to propagate, while others do not. Waves that

need a gaseous, liquid, or solid medium to travel through are known as mechan-

ical waves. In these types of waves, the particles of the medium actively partici-

pate in the wave propagation.

When a stone is thrown into a pond, a single wave is created that spreads

outward through the water. When the vibrations of a tuning fork travel through

a medium—whether air, liquid, or solid—we describe this as a sound wave

propagating through the medium. When the oscillations of electric and magnet-

ic fields transfer energy, this is called an electromagnetic wave. Examples of

electromagnetic waves include light waves, gamma rays, and microwaves.

These types of waves do not require a medium to propagate.

7.2.1 Characteristics of Waves

Here, we will discuss some properties of waves. The first property below (i)

applies only to mechanical waves, while the remaining properties (ii-v) apply to

almost all types of waves.

(i) ~~ When a wave propagates through a medium, the particles of the medium
oscillate (vibrate or go up-down) about its own position but are not
displaced permanently with the wave.

(iv) Reflection or refraction occurs for waves, it is discussed elaborately for
light, in the next chapter. At present you know that at the time of travelling from
one medium to another medium, if part of a wave returns back to the first
medium, it is called reflection (Figure7.02). When a wave travels from the first
medium to the second, it is refraction.
When we hear an echo of sound, it is
reflection. If we hear external sound when
we are submerged under water it is due to aN
refraction of sound. + +
(v) Among all the characteristics of waves,
the most important is superposition, even \ / \ /

in our daily lives. Let us consider that two 4 4

another wave is then negative what happens
then? These are the subjects of superposition,

only two easy matters are shown in figure 7.03. The two waves, can reinforce
one another or can destroy each other.
@ Do Yourself

Pour some water on a big plate in a bright place. Make sure that there is

no vibration on the plate. If you touch any point of the water, the wave

will spread around from that point and at the bottom of the plate you will

see its shadow or reflections. Touching just the centre of the water of the

plate, you will see a wave starting from the centre and spreading to the

edge of the plate and again returning to the centre after reflection from

there. If the wave can be created properly, meeting at the centre it will

again spread around. If you try a little bit, you can measure the velocity

of this wave. Try and see.

What will happen if you touch a little further from the centre? Try and

see.

When a wave propagates through a spring, the wave moves forward by
contraction and expansion of the spring. Again by shaking one end of a rope a
wave can be formed and can be sent through the rope. There is a fundamental
difference between the two waves. The wave formed in the spring was of
contraction and expansion, the direction of contraction and expansion of the
spring and the direction of wave is the same. The name of this wave is longitudi-
nal wave. Sound (Figure 7.04) is this type of a longitudinal wave.

When we produce a wave in the rope by shaking it, there the vibration of the
rope does not take place along the direction of the velocity of the wave. The
direction of vibration i.e. up and down of the rope, is perpendicular to the
direction of the velocity of the wave. The name of this type of a wave is a
transverse wave. The wave produced in water is an example.

7.2.3 Wave related quantities
The quantities we have talked about in simple harmonic motion, actually all of
them can be used in case of waves. In a wave complete oscillation occurs, it has
a time period, frequency and amplitude. We have seen that when a wave
propagates, if we look at a particular particle of a medium, we will see that the
particle is executing simple harmonic oscillation!
In case of wave we can talk about two new quantities, one of them is the
wavelength. Wavelength is the distance from any phase of the wave to the next
identical phase (Figure 7.04). Therefore, the distance travelled by a wave in one
time period is the wavelength.
In waves there is a second quantity which is not present in simple harmonic
vibration, this is wave velocity. The distance travelled by a wave in one second
is called the wave velocity. The number of time periods present in one second is
the frequency, if the frequency is f'and wavelength is 2, then the velocity can be
expressed as,
v=fA
When a wave travels from one medium to another medium, then change of its
velocity occurs. Since the frequency always remains the same, so when a wave §


--- Page 202 ---
Waves and Sound 197
travels from one medium to another then its wavelength changes. Therefore,
when waves propagate through different medium, its velocity or wavelength
changes, but frequency or time period never changes.

7.3 Sound Wave
To produce sound waves a source is needed, a medium to send it through, and
any type of receiver to receive that sound. There are many sources of sound
around us. Obviously, the most familiar source is our throat; sound is created by
the vibration of the vocal cord when air flows through it in our throat. We will
feel the vibration if we touch our throat during conversation.
Certainly you have noticed that the voice of a male is deep and the voice of
female and children is sharp. When we make a sound then air comes out through
throat from our lungs. In our throat there is a wind pipe through which air enters
the lungs and come out from the lungs. To produce sound larynx is situated upon
it. There are two membranes which work as valves, called the vocal cords.
These vibrate during the flow of air and produce sound. The vocal cords of
males become stiff with the increasing of age, whereas for females it remains
soft. This is why males produce sound of low frequency and females produce
sound of high frequency. Due to this, the voice of males is deep and that of the
females is high pitched.
@ Do Yourself
Cut a piece of paper as shown in Figure 7.10. Placing it between the two
fingers, blow, keeping it on your mouth. The two pieces of paper will vibrate
" like vocal cords of the larynx and produce a sound. Cut the paper in different
H ways and try to produce different kinds of sounds.

and solids but we are used to hearing sound using air as a medium. To show
that sound cannot propagate without a medium, we keep a calling bell as
shown in Figure 7.11 in the laboratory. The

kHz is generated, then the movement created in air will not be heard by us. To
detect such sounds we can use a special type of microphone or receiver. Many
animals can hear sounds of low frequency. Before earthquakes, sounds
of low frequency are generated, and
often hearing this sound animals panic
and leave the area. a

Characteristics of sound wave
Sound is a mechanical wave, because
sound wave is produced due to the
vibration of body, and for its transmission
an elastic medium is needed. This is 2 Figure 7.12: “Phone” can be made

of vibration is the same. The velocity of
sound depends on the property of the medium. In gaseous mediums its velocity
is low, in liquids greater, and in solids it is much more. The velocity of sounds
depends on the temperature and humidity of the medium. The intensity of sound
is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave. Therefore, if the
amplitude of a wave is high, the intensity of the sound will be high and if the
amplitude is low, the intensity will be low.

person should hold one cup and another should hold the second cup. One of
you speaks, and the other person listens. (Keep the thread stretched,
otherwise sound cannot be heard.) We are so used to hearing words in air;
we think that sound goes only in air. This experiment is the proof that sound

7.3.1 Echo
Since sound is one type of wave, it can have reflection. If someone speaks in a
big empty building it creates a reverberating sound, which is known as ‘Echo’.
This is due to reflection. Within the building the distance is not enough to
hear the sound separately. When we hear something the feeling persist for
around 0.1 s, so to hear two sounds separately, it needs separation of 0.1 s
differences between two sounds.Velocity of sound is 330 m/s, therefore to create
a difference of 0.1 s, sound has to travel at least 33 m.
If we stand in front of a big wall, a building, or a high hill at least half of this
distance (16.5 m), the sound will take 0.1 s to come back after being reflected
and we will hear the reflection of sound or echo. S

Waves and Sound 203
Bats have eyes and pretty good eye sight, yet they use echo during flight.
While flying a bat uses its throat to produce sound, if there is an obstacle in the front,
the sound returns after reflection, and the bat can estimate the distance from the
time of the returning sound. For this reason, the bat can fly even in dark
without being obstructed. We cannot hear the sound produced by the bat;
because the sound is ultrasound i.e. frequency of the sound is beyond our
hearing range. Bats can produce sound of frequency 100 kHz or more.
7.3.2 Variation of Velocity of Sound Table 7.0: velocity of sound
In air, velocity of sound is proportional to the in different medium
square root of temperature. i.e.
>
Here the temperature is not Celsius temperature. Hydrogen| 1281 |
Temperature in the Kelvin scale.
The velocity of sound does not depend on the air
pressure. But it is inversely proportional to the
square root of the density of air. So if there is water
vapor in the air, its density decreases, hence velocity increases.
Sound is a mechanical wave. It depends on the elasticity of the medium. The
nature of liquid and solid is different from air and naturally the velocity of sound
is different there. In liquid the velocity of sound is more than that in air and in
solid velocity of sound is even more than in liquid.
@ Do Yourself
Put your ear at one end of a table, tell someone to knock at the other end.
You will hear the sound of the knock clearly, because solid substances
are much better medium for sound than air.

7.3.5 Sound Pollution
Sound is essential in our life, but excessive sound makes our life intolerable.
Those who live in cities, especially those who live besides a road observe
that the sound produced from engines of
bus, car, truck and of continuous horns Table 7.02: Intensity of sound of different types
goes beyond our tolerance limit very
often. Most of the time we are used to
living in such types of pollution for a
long time. If we are fortunate enough to
go to a quiet place where there is no
sound pollution then suddenly we can
realize the importance of life without
sound pollution. The intensity of
different types of sound are shown in wines
Table 7.02.
Due to sound pollution, we are losing our hearing capability. To intensify the
problem many of us listen to songs using headphones in the ears.
To reduce sound pollution the first step is to make laws against it. The second
step is to make public awareness. This issue has to be clarified to all, using horns
while in cars as little as possible, installation of sound absorbing machine in the
industry, making less uses of loud speaker, using vehicles of less sound etc. In
addition, steps be taken of plantation of trees in the empty places in cities.

When light reflects on the objects around us and comes into our eyes, we can see
those objects. In the previous chapter we have learned about sound as a wave. In
this chapter we will learn about light as a wave. This wave is a different kind of
wave, called an electromagnetic wave.
When light is reflected on a plane mirror, it creates an image. All of us are
familiar with this image. If a curved mirror is used instead of plane mirror, it will
create a different kind of image. We will discuss different types of images in
different mirrors in this chapter.

8.1. Nature of Light
What we see with our eyes is light. We see trees, the sky, chairs and tables,
human beings, but that doesn't mean that these are light. Light reflects from
these objects and comes into our eyes, and the retina of our eyes creates and
sends signals to our brain. Then our brain can recognize whether it is a tree or a
human being. The whole process starts with light entering into our eyes.

Figure 8.01: Spectrum of light and sensitivity of eyes to different colors
Light is an electromagnetic and periodic wave. Every periodic wave has a wavelength,
which means light also has a wavelength. Those of us who have produced waves by
throwing a stone in a pond or by shaking a rope know that we can create waves of
different wavelengths if we desire. So light may have different wavelengths.
Electromagnetic waves may have any wavelengths.
These wavelengths may be greater than a few kilometers or may be one trillionth parts
of one meter. (1trillion=10'2) We can only see a small part of this large range of this.

‘We cannot see it if the wavelength is larger or smaller than this range. If the wavelength
is from 400 nm to 700 nm, we can see the electromagnetic wave, and we call that light.
The colors we see in our eyes are actually lights of different wavelengths. When the
wavelength is less, it becomes violet. When the wavelength increases, the light
gradually becomes blue, green, yellow, orange, and red, and at one point it disappears!
Human eyes cannot see beyond this range- but various insects or other living beings
can see outside this range. The sensitivity of human eyes to different colors of light is
shown in Figure 8.1.
@ Do Yourself
Hold a CD in the sunlight and reflect the light on a nearby wall. You can see
the full spectrum of light on the wall. CDs have sharp indentations which
work as grating and separate the colors.
In Figure 8.01, the name of different wavelengths is shown. If the wavelength is
less than the smallest wavelength of visible light, then we call it ultraviolet light.
If the wavelength is even smaller than it is called x-ray, and even smaller is
called gamma ray- which comes out from radioactive nucleus. If the wavelength
is larger than the largest wavelength of visible light, we call it an infrared ray. If
it gradually becomes larger we call them microwave, and then radio waves! To
learn physics this division of wavelengths is one of the most important topics.
@ Do Yourself
We cannot see infrared rays with naked eyes because of their high
wavelengths. A TV remote emits infrared rays that we cannot see. You may
see this through mobile phone camera because a special type of light sensitive
IC named CCD is used, which can detect some infrared light with visible
light. g

Reflection of Light 215

You can see that the wavelengths of visible light are very short but there are

many interesting experiments in physics, using these we can observe various

properties of this wavelength.

If we want to know more about light, we can start with reflection.

8.2. Reflection

If we talk about reflection what we

imagine is standing in front of a

mirror, but reflection is much absorption

more than that. When light is reflection

sent from one medium to another, hese

three different phenomena occur

simultaneously. One of them is

reflection and the other two are

refraction and absorption. (Figure first medium second medium

8.02)

While traversing from the first Figure 8.02: Reflection, refraction and

medium into the second medium, if absorption of light from one medium to

a part of light returns to the first another.

medium, the phenomenon is called reflection. Some parts of it may enter the

second medium which is called refraction and some of it may be absorbed which

is called absorption. In this chapter we will discuss reflection and in the next

chapter we will discuss refraction.

It has been said earlier that light is a wave. Generally a wave needs a medium to

travel, (If there is no water how will a wave be created in it). But this is different

in case of light. As this is a wave consisting of electric and magnetic fields, so

light does not need any medium to travel. Light can create its wave of electric

and magnetic fields and can propagate by itself. So when we talked about the

first and second medium for reflection or refraction, one of this medium can

even be vacuum. To speak the truth, the examples we see for reflection and
“ refraction in glass or water, there, one medium is glass (or water) and other is air.
s Air is such a light medium that we can consider it as a vacuum.

216 Physics
8.2.1 Laws of Reflection
Before understanding the laws of reflection, we need to define some terms.
When lights incident from one medium to another, for the time being we assume
that it is a plane surface. To understand better, we will assume that the light that
reflects is a light ray or a light beam. When a light ray from the first medium
to the second medium is incident on a point, first we have to imagine a
perpendicular at that point which is called a normal. Then imagine a plane that
contains this incident ray and the normal (Figure 8.03).
The ray, which is incident at a point,
from the first to the second medium
is called the incident ray (XO). The
ray which is reflected (OX) is called fir etm
the reflected ray. (You are realizing 9] P
that the ray which enters the second
medium is the refracted ray- we will
not discuss it in this chapter). The second medium
angle between the incident ray and Ben
the normal is called the incident
angle (0,) and the angle between the
reflected ray and the normal is the Figur 8.03: Reflection of light from first to
reflected angle (0). Now we can second medium
state the two laws of reflection:
First Law: The reflected ray will be in the plane which we imagined
through the incident ray and the normal.
Second Law: The reflected angle is equal to the incident angle.

Here two laws of reflection have been stated. But everything about reflection is
not yet discussed. The most important matter has not been discussed yet, that is
how much will it reflect? If a mirror is used for reflection, it reflects fully. But
the word reflection is not only meant for mirrors, it may occur between any two
mediums. Fresnel's law describes how much it will reflect. You will learn more
about it in higher classes. The main thing is, the larger the angle of incidence, the
more the amount of reflection (Figure 8.05). In normal glass, light is reflected
slightly (only 4-5% ), and the rest is refracted through the glass. But if the angle
of incidence is higher (like 80° or 90°,) then reflected light increases greatly. You
can test it standing beside a window.

8.2.3 Reflection from smooth and rough planes

Parallel light rays become parallel after reflecting from mirrors or smooth plane

surfaces because each ray obeys the law of reflection and reflects with an angle

of reflection equal to the angle of incidence. Even if the plane is not smooth,

every ray of light will obey the law of reflection. But the rays are incident at

different angles at different points of the plane, therefore the rays will reflect in

different angles after reflection. After reflection, the reflected rays are not

parallel and spread in different directions. (Figure 8.07) These types of

reflections are called irregular reflection.

Figure 8.07: Light reflects from smooth surfaces and scatters from rough surfaces

8.3 Mirror

All of us have seen mirrors. In a mirror a

clear image is formed due to uniform

reflection. A metal layer is placed behind a Fd 2

glass mirror for proper reflection. 4% light

is reflected from the front part of a mirror, p

but the back part reflects fully and forms £9

the original image. When the original igh

image is very important in optical Ry

instruments like telescopes, the silver or x Hy x

aluminum layer is coated on the glass B

surface, so that the two images, one 4%

lighter and other 96% clear are not formed, Figure 8.08: The image of X

--- Page 225 ---
age using geometry we need to draw
at least two rays. It will be easier to draw the picture if we consider XP (normal
to the plane) and XO as ray as shown in figure 8.09. Triangle OPX and OPX’ are
congruent. Therefore XP = X'P, which means the image has formed at a distance
equal to the distance of the object from the mirror.

Example

Question: Show that, triangle OPX R

We all have seen ordinary plain mirrors but
may not have seen a real spherical mirror. But
the main concept of a spherical mirror can be A »
seen in a new shiny spoon. Spherical mirrors \
are of two types- concave and convex. We can dry
make concave or convex mirrors by cutting a

surface with a silver or aluminium layer. ol =

or convex depends on which surface is coated Figure 8.16: The opposite plane

come from A and B respectively. The first ray has come to point X and the
second one has come to another point Y. The ray coming to point X will be
reflected back the way it has come. Let us extend this ray to the center of the
sphere, O. We can see that OX=r (radius of the sphere). The ray coming from
point B to point Y will create an angle of incidence Oiwith perpendicular
ON at that point. The angle of

reflection of the ray BY is 0,and it will ¢ oo

be reflected towards YP. If we extend Pau 5

to radius r. This is true for most Figure 8.18: A spherical convex mirror

So, FO=FY=FX= 1/2

or focal length f= 1/2

Question: If a plane mirror is considered a spherical convex mirror then
what is its focal length?

Answer: Infinite.

We will now see how the image is formed for a spherical mirror. You will see
that in a convex spherical mirror, images are always virtual where as in a
spherical concave mirror it may be both real or virtual, depending on the position
of the object.

8.5.1 Image in a Spherical Convex Mirror

We have already said that the outer part of a spoon acts as a spherical convex
mirror. You can see an upright and small image of yourself there. This means
that the image in a convex mirror should always be small. sg


--- Page 232 ---
Reflection of Light 227
To understand how an image is formed in a spherical convex mirror, we first need
to understand how light rays reflect on such a mirror. This depends on what
angle the light rays are incident on the mirror. If we know the rules of reflection
of only three special light rays, we can easily explain how an image is formed:

(i) If light rays are travelling towards the center (Figure 8.19, XN or YR ray),

they are reflected perpendicularly and go back along the line they were as
incident on.

(ii) If light rays travel parallel to the principal axis (Figure 8.19, XP), they will
appear to have diverged from the focal (F) point.

(iii) If the direction of the light ray is changed, it goes back the way it has
come. When the light ray is travelling towards the focus (Figure 8.19, QP),
it will be reflected parallel to principal axis (PX).

We can now create an image using these three rules. In figure 8.19, an object XY

is kept in front of a convex mirror. The light ray travelling from point Y towards

R will be reflected back along the same path towards Y, which means the image

of the point Y will be created somewhere along the line YO. To know exactly

where the image is formed, we Q

have to draw another light ray from [=

the point X in another direction but od Vi (8 X

that’s not necessary because we § a N

will find it by knowing where the 5 —e—Ie Y

image of point X is formed.

To find the image of the point X We igure 8.19: In convex mirror if an object XY

have done before. (As the YR ray was

reflected back to the point Y, similarly this ray will be reflected back towards X

from the point N on the mirror.) The second ray can be drawn parallel to YR, which will

be incident on point P of the mirror and will appear to have diverged from the point F.
a So we join the line FP and extend it towards Q.

The line FP intersects line OX at the point X' i.e. the image of the point X will
be formed on the point X'. The perpendicular drawn from X' to OY will intersect
line OY at Y'. Since it appears that the reflection of X is coming from point X’,
similarly it will appear that reflection of Y is coming from Y'. Hence, XY" will
be the image of XY.
We can observe that X'Y" is always smaller than XY and the further XY is from
the convex mirror, the smaller X"Y’ will get! One should know how to draw the
image of an object placed in front of a concave or convex mirror using the laws
of reflection. It is a very important procedure in physics.
It is clear that actually no light is coming from X'Y’, it just appears that the
image is there. Hence it is a virtual image. Comparing this with the images
formed by a plane mirror, we can see that-

(a) The position of this image will be between the focus and pole of the

mirror. The further the object is, the closer the image to the focus.

(b) This image is virtual.

(c) This image is upright.

(d) This image is small, and the further the object moves from the mirror,

the smaller the image becomes.
8.6 Concave Mirror
The inner side of a shiny spoon is an
example of a concave mirror. Those of you
who have looked at the inner side of a SAT
spoon must have noticed (Figure 8.20) that 73
the image is small, and the interesting thing ¢ " o J
is that the image is inverted! You can take / \(" oF
your finger very close to the spoon and [NN yz,

your finger slowly away from the spoon, AN
notice that your finger is starting to look

mage!)

So you can see that the outside part of a spoon works as a convex mirror and the

inside of a spoon works as a concave mirror! A real concave mirror is actually a

part of a sphere. In the case of a convex mirror light was reflected from the

outside convex shape and in the case of a concave mirror light will be reflected

from the inside concave shape. focal

If parallel rays are incident on a concave f Inatl ;

mirror the light rays will converge at a ant Fi =

point after reflection (Figure 8.21). You i i

can understand that this point is the focal i n

point of the concave mirror and the i +

distance from the pole to this point is pole - =

known as the focal distance. Light rays Pr <

don’t have any option of stopping, so after —=

converging at a point they will travel or

straight forward and it will look like light is

diverging from that point! Therefore before

reaching the focal point the rays are Figure 8.21: The focal distance of a

converging (convergent) and after reaching concave mirror is half of the radius of the

the focal point the rays are diverging sphere

(divergent).

Example

Question: If we imagine a plane mirror as a spherical concave mirror, what will

be its focal distance?

Answer: Infinite!

We got the same answer in case of convex mirrors, which means when the focal

distance increases to infinity then both convex and concave mirrors turn into
.. plane mirrors! The focal distance is half of the radius in concave mirrors as in a
El convex mirror.


--- Page 235 ---
230 Physics
8.6.1 Image on concave mirror
Now we have entered the most exciting part! In plane mirrors and convex
mirrors only one type of image was formed. Two types of images can be formed
on a concave mirror. If an object is placed within the focal distance it forms one
type of image, if it is placed at a distance greater than the focal distance it creates
another type of image.
Before starting that, let us know how light rays reflect from a spherical concave
mirror. If we know the rules of reflection of three special light rays in a concave
mirror, we can explain how the image is formed:
(i) If light ray travels along the radius or starts from the center (Figure 8.22,
OP or ON ray), it will reflect perpendicularly and go back the way it has
come.
(ii) The ray parallel to the principal axis will go through the focal point (F) after
reflection (QF).
(iii) If the direction of light ray is changed, it goes back the way it has come.
So a light ray (figure 8.22, FQ) going through the focus will reflect parallel
(QX) to the principal axis.
Now we can create image for concave mirrors.
At a distance less than focal length
In Fig 8.22, a concave mirror is shown. This mirror is part of a sphere whose
center is O, focal point of the mirror is F and we want to determine the image of
the object XY. Light coming from point Y reflects from point P of the concave
mirror and again goes through point Y towards point O. So it can be
comprehended that it will stay on a point of line OP or on an extended part of
line OP. To determine this exact point another ray has to be drawn from point Y
towards the concave mirror, but we are not doing that. If we can determine the
image of the point X as before we can find the exact location of the image of
point Y. To determine the image of point X, two lines have to be drawn from this
point. The first line will be an extended part of the line OX. It will touch the
8


--- Page 236 ---
Reflection of Light 231
concave mirror perpendicularly and after reflection will go back the way it has
come. As shown in figure, another ray from point X can be a ray parallel to the
principal axis. Because we have already known that parallel ray goes through the
focal point after reflection. So it will be incident on the point Q and after
reflection will go through the point F.
Son
= i
o
Figure 8.22: Image appears larger than the object in the
concave mirror placed inside the focal length.
After emerging from point X two rays of light will travel towards NO and QF
and we can see that these two rays have no chance of intersecting. So there
cannot be an image formed on the right side. But if we are able to look at the left
side from the right side then it will look like line ON and line FQ coincide at X'
point- so X’ will be the image of X. If we draw a perpendicular from this point
on OP axis then we will get X'Y" which is the full image of XY. No light is
coming from X'Y’, only we are thinking that the image is being formed there. So
this image is a virtual image. We can see from the figure that the image is larger
than the object. Not only will the image be larger but moving the object closer to
the focal point will create a yet larger image. (If the object is placed just on the
focal point then the reflected rays will become parallel meaning that the light
rays won't be able to coincide to create an image.)
Now let’s see what happens to the image when we place an object within the
focal distance of a concave mirror:
(a) The position of the image will depend on the position of the real object. The
closer the object is placed to the focus further the image will be created.

(b) It is virtual
(c) Straight

..  (d) The length of the image will also depend on its position, the closer it gets to

E the focal point the larger its length becomes.


--- Page 237 ---
232 Physics
At a distance greater than focal distance
Among all the images we have seen so far, this image is amazing, because we
will witness a real image for the first time, where light will be centralized where
the image will be created (Figure 8.23).
Let, the object be XY and like other
cases, the image of point Y will be on the
line YP. We have to draw two lines in 2
order to determine the image of point X. ~~ ;
One line XQ will be parallel to the axis, -

reflecting, it will become parallel to Rg, Figure 8.23: The image becomes inverted if

point, the reverse is also true. Light always follows its path in reverse direction. Lines
QF and RS intersect at the point X’ and point X" is the image of point X.
So, the normal drawn on line PO

BH images. This is shown in Figure 8.24.

--- Page 238 ---

would be the same as the object. These three different cases can be written precisely
when the object is outside the focal distances. If any object is placed outside the focal
length, the images will be as follows:

(a) The position of the image depends on the position of the object. When the
object is placed within the focal point and at concave mirror's center, the
image will be formed outside the center. As the object is placed outside the
center of curvature of the concave mirror, the image be formed inside the
center. If the object is placed at the center, the image will also form at the
center.

(b) The image is real. So, as we can say that if the image itself is the object, the
object becomes the image.

(c) The image is inverted.

(d) The height of the image will depend upon its position. If it is formed in
between the focal point and the center of curvature, the height of the image
will be greater than the object. The nearer to the focal point, the greater it
is. If the object is outside the center of curvature, its height will be shorter
than the real object. If the object is placed at the center of curvature, the
size of the image will be the same as the object.

Real image is a very important idea. We will find in the next chapter how real
images can be formed with a lens. You have already seen that there are real light
rays in a real image, so if it is projected on a screen, it is possible to see the
image. In ordinary mirrors, you can look at yourself but you cannot project
yourself on screens with ordinary mirrors.

8.7. Magnification
We have seen that an image can be larger or smaller than the real object, this is
called magnification. Magnification refers to how large the image is than
the real object. If the length of an object is | and length of its image is I, then
magnification is 4

m=
When we see an object through a telescope, how large the object is when seen
with the naked eye as compared to its size as seen by a telescope is known as the
telescopes magnification.
8.8 Use of Mirror
8.8.1 Plane Mirror
Simple mirrors are most commonly used in our daily lives. Ordinary mirrors are
used whenever a light ray travelling in one direction is to be redirected in another
direction. You must have noticed that in a plane mirror right and left side
alternates. So if we want to keep the right and left unchanged, the image of one
mirror is to be reflected by a second mirror.
The left and right sides are interchanged in a plane mirror image. Right and left do not
interchange if two mirrors are used as a single mirror by keeping them at 90°
angle with each other. You may demonstrate it by using two mirrors (Figure
8.26).

D| @.t
Figure 8.26: In ordinary mirror the left and right are interchanged, where as two
3 mirrors are kept at right angles to leave left and right unchanged.
BS


--- Page 241 ---
236 Physics
An important point to note is, when a good reflection is necessary, quite a
different kind of reflection is done instead of using an ordinary plane mirror. We
will see in the next chapter how light is reflected by a completely transparent
medium.

8.8.2 Convex Mirror

A diminished and erect image can be created by using a convex mirror. So a
convex mirror is used to see a large scene in a small region. Expert drivers
always trying to notice of what is happening behind the car while driving. So,
there is a rear view mirror in front of the driver. Convex mirrors are used in these
mirrors so that drivers can see a vast area behind the car with the help of a small
mirror.

8.8.3 Concave Mirror

The most important use of concave mirrors

is in telescopes. Concave mirrors are used in

the largest and the smallest telescopes of the

world. Many of us generally think that the

only function of a good telescope is to create

a large image of the small objects situated Ll

far away. Actually that’s not true, the ii

function of a good telescope is also to create

a distinct image in very dim light. That is

why the bigger the concave mirror is, the

more light it can converge to create a clear

image. Concave mirrors are used in all of

the large telescopes of the world. Figure 8.27: When an intense
Another use of concave mirrors is to create a light source is placed at the focal
parallel beam of light. Concave mirrors are point, then that light is reflected
used in search lights of ships or launches. The at the concave mirror as parallel
light source is kept at the focus of the mirror, beam of light.

so the light rays are incident on the concave mirror and reflected back as parallel
beams of light. The torch lights you use in your daily life, also have the bulb kept just
at the focus of a concave mirror!

Since an erect and magnified image is formed when an object is placed within the focal IS
length of a mirror, we use concave mirrors if we want to see a magnified image of any S


--- Page 242 ---
Reflection of Light 237
object. Doctors and dentists often use concave mirrors when they try to observe
something.
8.8.4 Safe Driving
Development of the transportation system of a country is necessary when a country is
trying to develop. New roads are constructed and vehicles of many types start moving
on those roads. You must have noticed that the huge number of vehicles travelling
through the roads in our country and how the number of vehicles is increasing day by
day. A huge amount of time is wasted because of traffic jams created due to insufficient
roads and many people die due to accident on highways. These deaths occur mainly
due to the reason that drivers jeopardize safe driving for reaching destinations quickly
rather than safely. Many kinds of awareness is required for safe driving, correct use of
light is one of them.
Brake lights play an important role while driving. Seeing this light the driver of the
preceding car can be sure if the car in front is trying to slow down or in which direction
the car will go. Whether the car will change lanes or not, the turn lights are used to
inform others. The head lights in front of the car illuminates the dark roads but there are
some specific rules for using headlights. The high beams are not used when a car is
coming from the opposite direction so that the eyes of the driver are not dazzled by the
bright lights. A driver has to be aware of the sides and back of the car besides the front.
That’s why there’s a rear view mirror in front and side view mirror on both sides of the
car. Convex mirror are used here so that an image of a large area can be created in such
a small mirror. A good driver always keeps track of what is happening on all sides of
the car as well as whats happening in front of the car.
8.8.5 Invisible Curves of Hilly Roads
Hilly roads are usually curved as well as uneven. Besides, there are hills on one side
and a deep ditch on the other side of the road. This is why the drivers should be careful
while driving on hilly roads. Still driving in some areas can be very risky. Especially
when there is almost a 90° turn ahead and the driver cannot see what is coming from
the other direction. In these circumstances, a plane mirror is placed at 45° at the turns.
“ Then the drivers can see what’s happening on both sides and driving in those areas becomes
5 comparatively safe.

The velocity of light in a vacuum is 2.99792458 x10* ms’. If light enters a
medium, its velocity decreases from this. To explain this process a quantity named
refractive index is defined. You can easily show that light changes its direction due to
the change of its velocity while passing from one medium to another. Due to this
property of light, or refraction, a wonderful event may happen named total
internal reflection. We will discuss various uses of total internal reflection in this
chapter.
Convex and Concave lens can be made by using refraction. Which type of
images can be formed using these two lens will be discussed in this chapter. PS

You know that when light moves from one medium to another, three different
events may happen . One is reflection, where some amount of light come back
to the first medium while entering the second medium and we have discussed
this in the previous chapter. Another one is refraction, when light passes from the
first medium to the second. We will discuss this in this chapter. Another one is
absorption, when some amount of light is absorbed, which we will not discuss
here.

rough a medium this velocity decreases. In a medium, the factor by
which the velocity of light reduces is the refraction of light of that medium .
For instance the velocity of light in water is 2.26x10% ms therefore the
refractive index of water is

c 299% 10° ms?
nT 22x 10h met

i.e. the velocity of light in a vacuum is 1.33 times greater than the velocity of
light in water .
The refractive index of the glass fiber in a Table 9.01: Refractive index

. . of some substance
fiber optic cable is 1.5.
Therefore, the velocity of light in the fiber is
v=3x10°ms?/1.50 = 2.00 x 10% ms™
Refractive index is a number and it has no
unit. As the maximum velocity of light is c¢,
the value of »n always greater than 1 . In
Table 9.01 the refractive index of some substances are given.
Naturally, the refractive index of a vacuum will be 1.
The refractive index of air is 1.00029 which is so close to 1that we will take it as
1 during calculations.

Example
Question : Calculate the velocity of light in the mediums shown in Table 9.01 .
Answer : Velocity of light in any medium: v = < §


--- Page 250 ---
Refraction of light 245
In vacuum v = 3 x 10% ms /1.00 = 3 x 10° ms™*
In air v=3x10%ms"/1.00029 = 3 x 10% ms!
Inwater v=3x10°ms!/1.33 = 2.26 x 10° ms!
In normal glass v =3 x 10° ms™'/1.52 = 2x 10° ms!
In diamond v = 3 x 108 ms!/2.42 = 1.24 x 10° ms"
To determine the refractive index of a
medium is, the wavelength of light
for which the refractive index is
measured must be stated, because the first medium
refractive index depends on the 90° (]
wavelength of light.
9.1.1 Laws of refraction .
second medium
What we need to understand the Boi
N . 1
laws of refraction are already known.
In the case of reflection of light we
have imagined a normal from the Figure 9.01 : Refraction of light from
point of incident. We do the same first medium to the second
here . In Figure 9.01 we will call the
angle between the incident ray and the normal as the angle of incidence and the
angle between the refracted ray and the normal as angle of refraction.
First Law of Refraction: The refracted ray will lie on the same plane as the
incident ray and the normal.
Second Law of Refraction: If the refractive index of the first medium is n ,
the refractive index of the second medium is n,, the angle of incidence is 0, ,
the angle of refraction is 6,, then
ni sinbh = ny sin 6;
If you remember this, you will be able to solve all problems about
refraction of light.

Bl

246 Physics
If the first medium is air then taking n =1, (Figure 9.02)
we can write _ sing
Ny =—-+
sin 6,
As the value of n, is greater than 1, 6, < 6, i.c after refraction, the ray of light
will bend towards the normal . We say the medium is denser if the value of n is
greater . We are not calling the medium denser due to its mass . Here the
meaning of a denser medium the that the value of n is more . Therefore,
according to the second law of refraction, when a ray of light enters from a rarer
medium to a denser medium, the refracted ray bends towards the normal. When
it enters from a denser medium to a rarer medium, it goes away from the normal
(Figure 9.02). Remember that refractive index of a medium has no direct relation
with density of that medium.

Here only the incident ray and refracted rays are drawn, as refraction of light is
discussed, but we must remember that when a ray of light goes from one
medium to another every time some amount of light is reflected. How much light
will be reflected and how much light will refracted depends on the angle of
incidence. When there is an increase in the angle of incidence, the reflection
increases.

9.1.3 Relative refractive index
We said that the refractive index of a medium is always greater than 1. Because
, as the refractive index of a medium is a comparison of the velocity of light in
that medium with the velocity of light in a vacuum, it will be greater than 1.
Sometimes the refractive index of a medium is expressed in comparison with
another medium. Then the refractive index may be less than 1 depending on
which medium is being compared with which.
For example, if water is the first medium and glass is the second medium (Figure
9.05) th

9.2 Total Internal Reflection
When discussing reflection, we learned that when perfect and total reflection
is needed, then instead of mirror a perfect transparent medium is
used, and a kind of reflection is made. This is called total internal
reflection. It is a very easy and exciting process. Here, light rays are sent
to a rarer medium from a denser medium using the refraction of light. We
know (and have used many times) that the law of refraction is
n, sing, =n,siné, ie if n, is greater than n, then 6, is greater than 6,.
Suppose you are sending a ray of light from a denser(n, ) medium to a rarer(n,)
medium (Figure 9.06).According to the laws of reflection and refraction some
amount of light will be reflected and some will be refracted . As 6, will be greater
than 6, therefore staying 6,(90°,6, will be equal to 90° and after this there will
be no scope of light to be refracted, i.e when 6, will be equal to 90°, total
light has to be reflected . The value of 6, at which 6, =90°is called the critical angle 6,

ted . If you have a prism then you will be able to
see total internal reflection with your own eyes. In Figure 9.07, at the glass-air
separating surface the incident angle is 45° ,which is greater than the critical
angle 41.8° of glass-air. Therefore total internal reflection will occur here.
Example

Question : What will happen if you want to do this experiment under
water ? (n, for glass is 1.52 and n, for water is 1.33)
Answer: In water B= 0.88 therefore the critical angle of glass will be 61.6°
because sin 61.6° =0.88
or sin(0.88) = 61.6"
As the angle of incidence is 45° , which is less than the critical angle 61.6", total
internal reflection will not occur.
Question : Light incidents at an angle of
75° from a medium of refractive index |

1.45. With what angle will the ray of |
light emerge if there is air on the other aA

side . H
Answer : We know ENED
ny sind; = n, sin, | 0;
1.45 X sin75° = 1X sin0, |

sinf, = 1.40
We know the value of sin 0, will not be greater than 1, but here it happens
because light is totally reflected without refracting . Therefore whenever we
want to see the refraction of light from a denser medium to a rarer medium then
it is better to determine the critical angle first. If light incidents at an angle less
than this critical angle, only then it is possible to get refraction.


--- Page 257 ---
252 Physics
In this case if the critical angle is,
. 1
sing, = Tas = 0.69
0, = 43.6°
Therefore, if light incidents at angle 75°, then total internal reflection will happen
instead of reflection.
9.2.1 Rainbow
You may be thinking that you have never seen total internal reflection. But those
who have seen a rainbow have seen total internal reflection . A rainbow is
formed by the total internal reflection of water. Those who have not separated
white light into different colors with prism , have seen this in a rainbow . If the
sun shines after rain, we see a rainbow. Because there are water droplets in the
air, in that water total internal reflection occurs, where different colors of light
bends in different angles . The bands of different color of the rainbow are formed
by these light rays . Those of you who have seen a rainbow have seen that the
rainbow always forms in the sky opposite to the sun. Surely now you have
understood the reason for this.

9.2.2 Mirage
Mirage is a common phenomenon in the desert .You will be surprised to hear
that a mirage also happens due to total internal reflection. The word comes from
changes of density of air due to heat in the desert. We know heated air, being
lighter, goes up, but due to the heated sands in the desert the nearby air may .
hotter than the upper air. Thus, we can imagine the air in desert as in Figure 9.09. gd


--- Page 258 ---
Refraction of light 253
In order to illustrate this easily only three layers are shown. The density of the
air in upper level is high and so the refractive index is high. Air in the lower level
is heated, so density is low and its refractive index is also low. During refraction
of light from the tree, in each layer the angle of refraction will increase and at the
lowest level total internal reflection may happen. When entering a medium of
lower refractive index from a medium of higher refractive index there is a
possibility of crossing the critical angle because the angle of incidence is higher
if it is seen from far. So a mirage is seen from far and cannot be seen from near.
If a person looks at a tree from far away, he can see the tree directly, and due to
total internal reflection he can also see an image of that tree under the tree. It will
seem that the image of the tree is seen due to the existence of water under the
tree. After coming closer, it will be clear that there is no water.

While driving a car on a heated road in the summer, a wet road is seen far away
for the same reason. After coming closer it is seen that the road is dry. This is
also a kind of mirage.
9.3 Uses of refraction
There are different uses of refraction. The uses which play
important roles in our lives are:

lass. The inner part of it is called the reflection.
core and the outer part is called clad . Although the two are made of same glass,
the refractive index of the inner part (core) is greater than that of the outer part.
For this reason light can be taken very long distances by trapping it in optical
fibers the through total internal reflections (Figure 9.10). Light can be taken
hundreds of kilometers through optical fibers, because the absorption of light in
optical fibers is very low. Absorption would have been greater if the visible light
was there so infrared rays of long wavelength are used in optical fibers. How
optical fibers are used in a process called endoscopy of medical science is
described in the last chapter.
Example
Question: If the refractive index of the ————————

Therefore light has to incident at an angle of 75° or more.

called prism. The light goes out ina Figure 9.12 : Prism is used instead

direction parallel to the direction IMIFTOr in periscope

in which it enters the transparent

medium. Though the direction

remains unchanged, the light ray bends a little bit from the main ray. In the case

of prism the direction of light changes (Figure 9.13). While entering the first

surface the ray bends toward the normal. The second surface is not parallel, so

when going out from this surface the light ray moves away from the normal but

cannot move towards the main ray. Though in a prism the direction of light

changes, it is important for another reason. After entering the prism, how much

the ray of light will deviates from the main direction depends on the refractive

index of the prism. We know that the refractive index depends on the wavelength

or the color of light. So there is a different refractive index for different colors.

Therefore, if there exists different colors in the same ray of light, when passing

through a prism the ray of light of each color will change its direction in different
I. angles. Therefore we will see that when coming out from the prism the light is
H separated into its component colors. This was first shown by Newton.

9.4 Types of lenses prism
In convex and concave mirrors, we've seen that, when light enters these mirrors,
sometimes it focuse to a point (converging ray) or sometimes it diverges
(diverging ray) and the image is formed. That image is sometimes real and
sometimes virtual. Sometimes it is big, sometimes it is small. Using these images
in many ways, optical instruments have been
developed.
Many types of images are made by convex or
concave mirrors which also be made by
lenses and they are used in many ways. We
have all seen lenses (because the spectacles
are actually a kind of lens). Those of you who
have used spectacles or have seen others using
spectacles have certainly noticed that lens of
spectacles can be divided into two types.

which small things are seen bigger are called convex or (sometimes) converging
lenses. The lenses with which big things are seen smaller are called concave or

are seen bigger or convex lens is thicker than the edges. And the mid portion of ~~ 5

the concave lens is thinner than the edges as shown in 9.14. If we see the cross
section of the concave or convex lens we can understand that both are bound
with two round circles. The radius of these two circles can be different or the
same. The centers of these circles are called the centres of curvature. In the
picture 9.15, C, and C, are the centres of curvature.
Different kinds of lenses are used in everyday life or in different subjects of
science.

We will keep our discussion limited to
thin lenses. Though the difference
between thin and thick lenses can be
understood by their names, let us
explain this more. Looking at the cross

though the lens has a curvature in the
surface, at the middle the two surfaces
are almost parallel. We know when light
passes through a parallel surface it is ofiginal ray

out roughly in the same direction, there is no deviation .
In the case of those lenses in which light ray passing through it, the direction of
the ray remains unchanged is called a thin lens. (Figure 9.17). We can say that
the point of the middle of a thin lens through which light rays do not deviate
when passing through it is called the center of that lens (Figure 9.17, point O)
or the Optical center.

That point is called the focal point and the distance from the focal point and the
center of lens is called the focal length. (Figure 9.18)
In case of a convex mirror, light is incident from one side. In the case of a
lens, light can be incident on it from both sides. Every lens has a focal length
.The focal length of a lens remains the same whichever direction the light is
incident on it. If parallel light

the angle with which the light ray is
falling. If we know the three special rules of refraction of light, we can explain
how the image is formed:
(i) If the ray of light is centripetal (Figure 9.20, YO or XO ray) it goes
straight after refraction.
(ii) The rays which are parallel with the principle axis, (Figure 9.20 XP) will
(PS) appear to diverge from the focal point (F) after refraction.
(iii) If the direction of the light ray is reversed then it goes back through
the way it came. Therefore, if any ray goes (Figure 9.20, SP) towards
the focus then it will be refracted in parallel with the principle axis.
Now we can find out how the image of an object will be in a concave lens.
Suppose an object XY is kept near a concave lens. (Figure 9.20) To make the
analysis easy, we have taken the point Y of that object on the principle axis YR.
To find where the image of a point will be formed, at least two rays should be
drawn from that point. But we can find the image of Y without drawing two rays.
It is possible to draw a ray along the principle axis YR, so we know the image of
3 this point will be formed on this axis. We will get the image of point Y if we


--- Page 265 ---
260 Physics
draw a normal on this axis from image of X.
Imagine two rays from point X, one is XP which is incident on the lens in
parallel with the axis. This will diverge when emerged and will appear to
diverge from the focus, so if a line is drawn from the focus F to P and
elongated, then we’ll find
that ray. Let us draw the
second ray from point X Cr 3
towards the center of the X f
lens. According to the fa
rules of thin lenses it will | ’
emerge directly along the - I
direction of XT. The point Y F v Fiot R
where XT and FS T
intersect each other is the
image X of X. If we draw
a normal from X' on the
axis we will get the image
X'Y'of XY. Figure 9.20 : An object looks small in a concave
lens

The things which are seen in the case of convex mirror are true in the case of
concave lens.

(a) Its position will be in between the center and focus of the lens.

(b) It is virtual

(c) Itis erect.

(d) It is small.
9.4.2 Convex Lens
The images in convex lens are amazing. The image which we got from a
concave mirror, is the same as the images in a convex lens. We have seen in the
case of a convex mirror that if a parallel ray falls on it, then it converges at the
focal point. The same thing happens in the case of a convex lens, if parallel rays
fall on it, they will meet at the focal point (Figure 9.21) and again spread out.
Therefore, using previous logic we can say that if light diverges from a point and
the source of the divergent light (Figure 9.22) is placed in the focal point of a
lens, then while passing through the lens, rays of light will emerge as parallel a


--- Page 266 ---
Refraction of light 261
rays (in the case of light, it is always true that if the light goes from A to B and if
the direction of the ray is changed, it will always go from B to A). Now let us find
the position of the image for different positions of an object .

Before starting, let us learn how light ray refracts in a convex lens. If we know
three special rules of the refraction of light through convex lens, we can describe
how the image is formed .

(i) If the rays of light is centripetal (Figure 9.23, YO or XO ray) it goes

straight after refraction.

(ii) The rays which are parallel with the principle axis, (Figure 9.23, XO) will

(CT) pass through focal point (F) after refraction.

(iii) If the direction of the light ray is reversed then it goes back the way it
came. Therefore, if any ray goes (Figure 9.23, TC) through the focus then
it will be refracted in parallel (CX)

Now we can form the image for a convex lens.

Imagine an object XY, which is kept between the lens and the focal point (Fig-
ure 9.23). By the same logic described before, we can say that the image of point

on this axis, we’ll get the position of the image of Y.

Now let’s draw two rays from the point X. XC line, which is parallel with the
axis will go towards the direction of T through the focal point F. If a ray from
point X is drawn through the center point of the lens, it will go straight along XO
towards S. CFT and XOS will not meet going forward, which means there is no
chance of forming a real image. If the two lines are extended backward, they
will meet at point X', which is the image of X.
The normal which is drawn from the point X ‘on the line YF touches YF at the
point Y'. This is the image of point Y.
The closer the XY object is to the lens ,the bigger the image will be. The closer
the object is to the focal point F, the bigger the image will be. When the object
will be exactly on point F, the size of the image will be infinite. Now we can say,
if an object is kept between the center of the lens and the focal point of a convex
lens, the image of the object:
(a) Will be formed in the same direction as the object.
(b) Will be virtual.
(¢) Will be erect and

Outside the focal length
Now let’s see what happens if the object is kept outside the focal length. Three
different things can happen in this case, like in a concave mirror. (i) The object
is outside the focal length but inside twice of the focal length. (ii) The object is
outside twice of the focal length and (iii) The object is exactly on the twice of the
focal length. Let’s examine this

The point x, where the two
lines meet, is the image of point X. If a normal is drawn from X' to the axis
YO, then the point will be the position of the image of the point Y. Therefore, for
the image of XY. we can say :

(a) The position of the image will be outside twice of the focal length

(b) Itis real

(c) Itis inverted

(d) It is bigger than the size of the object
(ii) Now let’s see what will happen if the object is kept outside twice of the focal
length. It is seen that if the object XY is kept at exactly twice of the focal length
(Figure 9.25), then the size of the image will be same as the object XY and the
position of the object will be at the same distance from the center of the lens.

side twice of its focal length, then a real image
of the object is formed. If the object is kept at the position of the image, then where
will the image be formed?
Answer: If the direction of the light ray is changed, then one is converted to another.
Do Yourself
If the light from a distant object falls on a lens, then it forms its image on
the focal point of the lens. Using this process you can find the focal length of
a convex lens. In order to do it you should move the lens forward and
backward until a distinct image is formed on the wall. When the image is
distinct, then measure the distance from the lens to the wall. This is the focal
length of this lens.
If you don’t have any convex lens, you can do the experiment using the glass
of spectacle. Often the spectacles of elderly people are made with convex
lenses. If closer things are seen bigger by the glass of the spectacle, then
you’ll understand that it is a convex lens.
9.4.3 Power of Lens
The most familiar use of lens is in spectacles. If you have experimented with the
lenses of spectacles of many people, you have seen that many of their spectacles are
made of convex lens, and many are made of concave lens. Usually we explain the
lenses by discussing power.
Forma-34, Physics, Class 9-10


--- Page 271 ---
266 Physics
You have certainly heard people say that the power of a lens of somebody is high.
What do we mean by the word power?
The conception of power
comes from the matter of Xx

which the object looks bigger. Ree
If you think about it you will ~ Ho
see that the smaller the focal | he SL

seen bigger (Figure 9.27). ® 8
Therefore the power of a lens P Tp N ET
is inversely proportional to the
focal length. If the focal length =
is fin meters then unit of power
P is the diopter. If the power of Figure 9.27 : The lens which have as much as
the glass is 2.5 (Nobody uses alier the focal length , the object is seen to be
diopter in general conversation). ager
Then the focal length of this
glass will be
f= H = = m = 0.4m (the unit is in meter)
Power is not only used only for convex lens to show bigger objects. In the case of
concave lens the same power is used to show smaller images. In the concave lens in
which the object is seen as much as smaller, the power will be greater or the focal
length will be smaller. In the case of a convex lens the power is positive and in the
case of a concave lens the power is negative. )

If you comb your hair in winter and then hold the comb near some small pieces

of paper, you will notice that the pieces jump towards the comb. Again during

storm, flashes of lightning and thunder bolts rumble and shake up the whole

area. Static electricity is responsible in both the cases. Everything around us

consists of molecules and atoms the nucleus is the center of an atom and the

electrons revolve around the nucleus. An electron is negatively charged and a

nucleus is positively charge. If one or more electrons can be separated in any

way, static electricity is produced. We will discuss the various processes of static

electricity in this chapter. We will moreover know how force acts between two

charges when they are kept near to each other. IS

10.1 Charge

If you comb your hair in winter and then hold the comb near some small pieces
of paper, you will notice that the pieces jump towards the comb. In cold
countries during winter air is very dry. When babies crawl on carpet, their hair
seems to stand straight and it seems one hair is pushing the other. All of you have
seen thunder bolts during stormy night and observed how flashes of lightning
comes towards the earth.

In the attraction of paper, repulsion of hair or thunder bolt- the basic thing behind
these three phenomena is charge. To know what charge is and why charges
attract or repulse or create thunder bolts, we have to understand the basics, we
have to know how atoms and molecules are formed.

We all know everything is made of an atom and molecule. There are 118
atoms in this world, among which 83 are stable, only with these atoms millions
of different molecules are formed. Water is made of two hydrogen and a oxygen
atom, a sodium atom and a chlorine atom forms table salt, a carbon with four
hydrogen atoms form the cooking gas, etc. (You need not be surprised, there are
only 50 letters in Bengali, with these alphabets thousands of words are built!)
Atom is the building block of everything. Nucleus is the center of an atom and
electrons revolve around the nucleus. The nucleus consists of a proton and a
neutron. A proton is positively charged while a neutron is chargeless and an
electron is negatively charged. The charge of a proton and electron is equal but
opposite and the magnitude of this charge is 1.6 x 10” coulomb. In an atom
generally there are the same number of electrons and protons and so an atom is
charge neutral. Hydrogen is the simplest atom. The nucleus of hydrogen atom
consists of only one proton and only one electron is revolving around it. The
next atom is helium which consists of two protons in the nucleus (and two
chargeless neutron) and two electrons outside the nucleus. In this way larger
atoms are formed. Excluding hydrogen atom, we can say the number of protons
that a nucleus there is at least the same number or generally more than this
number of neutrons present.

Electrons outside the nucleus do not revolve in the same orbit. As shown in
figure 10.01, electrons on filling up one orbit go to the next orbit. Electrons in
orbits close to the nucleus are strongly bound, but for some atoms electrons in
the outer orbits can be separated with a little effort. Ionization is a process of =
removing the electrons. S


--- Page 278 ---
Static Electricity 273
Normally atoms are charge neutral and that means there are an equal number of
electrons and protons in an atom. But if an electron is removed from the
outermost orbit, then the number of protons is more than the electrons and the
atom is not electrically neutral anymore, the amount of positive charge within it
increases. If one electron is removed, one positive charge is developed in the
atom, if two electrons are removed,

two positive charges are developed.

We then say that the atom has been

ionized or charged. As an atom is Electron

electrons that are nearly free; in such

materials electrons can make

movement very easily within the

materials. We call these materials

electric conductors. Again, there are some materials within which there are no
electrons that can move freely, in these materials electrons are tightly bound.
These are called nonconductors. Metals like gold, silver, copper etc. are good
conductors of electricity. Wood, plastic, glass, rubber etc. are nonconductors of
electricity.

If we have understood the topics explained so far about the structure of atoms,
the next topics following static electricity will be very easy to understand.

10.2 Static Electricity by Friction
If a glass rod is rubbed by a piece of silk, (Figure 10.02) electrons start to move
from the glass to the silk. So the glass rod is positively charged and the silk
negatively. This happens because silk has more affinity for electrons than the
glass. Again if a plastic is rubbed using a flannel ( or wool), electrons will move
to plastic from the flannel. Because plastic has more affinity for electrons than
the flannel.

Figure 10.02: If glass is rubbed with silk and a plastic is rubbed with flannel

Now we can do an experiment. Suppose, using glass and silk we have positively
charged two pieces of glass. If we carefully hang one piece of glass with
insulator silk and then bring the other close to it then we will notice that the glass
that is hanging is going away due to repulsion (Figure 10.03).
Similarly if we charge negatively two pieces of plastic and hang one of them
with silk thread and bring the other near to it, we will see the same result, one is
repelling the other. Now if we bring the positively charged glass rod near to the
negatively charged plastic rod, then we will see, they will attract one another.
‘When we learnt gravitational force, there was only one type of mass, so only one
type of force, and it was attraction. Because there is only one type of mass, there
is nothing called a negative mass. Now we see there are two types of charges
and so forces are of two types, sometimes attractive, and sometimes repulsive. s

If we have done the experiment properly, we will find that similar charges

repulse each other and opposite charges attract each other.

10.3 Electrical Induction

At the beginning of this chapter it was said that if you comb your hair and then

hold the comb near some small pieces of paper, you will notice that the pieces of

paper jump towards the comb. The comb is attracting the pieces of paper. We

know that negative charge has been gathered in the comb and due to this reason

the comb is attracting the pieces of paper. But there is a slight complexity. We

know opposite charges attract each other, so to attract the pieces of paper

opposite charge of the comb has to be created in the paper. Since we know the

pieces of paper have no charge, then why is the comb attracting them?

This happens due to a process called electric induction. If charge is

accumulated in glass or plastic and brought near a neutral body, then charge will

be produced in the neutral body. To explain it, a metal sphere is shown in Figure

10.04 and kept on a non-conducting stand. Now if positive charge is

accumulated in a glass rod by rubbing it carefully with silk, and this is brought

near the sphere, negative charges of the sphere will come closer due to attraction

and positive charges will move away towards the back portion of the sphere.
. Now the glass rod is positively charged and the part of the sphere near the glass
d rod is negatively charged, so they will attract each other.

Now we will understand the phenomenon of attraction of paper by the comb.

negative charge is induced in the farther parts. The positively charged part of the
paper is attracted by the comb and the negatively charged part of the paper is

You have understood by now why they happen.
The event of the comb has been explained. The crawling of the little baby is also
easy to understand. Due to friction with the carpet, charge accumulates in its
body and spreads to the hair also. All hairs have same charge. We know similar
charge repulses, so each hair repulses each other and becomes straightened. Now
we can explain the event of the thunderbolt too. Due to friction among clouds,
charge gets separated. When a large amount of charge is accumulated in the
clouds, it creates induction of opposite charge below. Sometimes that is so large
. in amount, it becomes connected with the clouds by piercing the air. We call this
§ lightning. (Figure 10.07).

10.3.1 Electroscope

An electroscope is a wonderful equipment for test of static electricity. The

equipment is very simple. To determine

the presence of charge, it contains two

light leaves of gold, aluminum or some

other metal. These two leaves are connect-

ed to a metal disc by a highly conducting i

rod. The whole setup is kept inside a glass [wy = | == ==__-- J

the glass rod touches the metal disc of the

electroscope, some charge will immediately go to the disc. As the disc is

connected with the metal rod and the leaves, the charge will spread

everywhere. When similar charges appear in the gold leaves, the leaves will
repulse each other and create a gap

VY 4 between them.
&7
c 3) Similarly, if a comb is rubbed with
flannel, negative charge will accumulate
Fy in the comb. Now if this comb touches the
disc, negative charge will spread up to the
gold leaves and they will repulse each
£ other and create a gap.

Determining the Nature of Charge
If charge is accumulated in an object, we
can determine whether it is positive or
negative using an electroscope. At first,
we have to give some known charge to the
disc of the electroscope. If we create
a positive charge in the glass rod by &


--- Page 284 ---
Static Electricity 279

rubbing it with silk and then touch it to the disc, the reduction of gap between the

leaves will indicate the electroscope has negative charge. If the gap increases,

then it will indicate the presence of positive charge.

Induction of Charge

‘We can determine if an object contains charge without touching the disc. Let us

imagine, a positively charged rod is brought near the disc. Then the disc will

have negative charge due to induction (Figure 10.08). To make induction of

negative charges, negative charge from other parts of the electroscope will have

to come in the disc and as a result positive charge will be created in the gold

leaves too. This positive charge will push gold leaves apart.

Instead of bringing a positively charged object, if we bring a negatively charged

object, then there will be gap too between the gold plates. This time it will be due

to accumulation of negative charges there.

10.4 Electric Force

‘We have seen earlier that opposite charges attract each other and similar charges

repel each other. But we do not

know yet how attraction or

repulsion works. To know this, we r

need to look at Coulomb's law. q; qa,

Coulomb determined how much

force works between two charges. Figure 10.09: The force F acting

the unit of k will be Nm?*/C?, so that the unit of F becomes N.

The value of &:
k =9 x 10° Nm2/C?

Coulomb is the unit of charge. We will see in the next chapter that the flow of
charge is electricity or current, and the unit of current is ampere. If one ampere
current flows for one second, the amount of charge that flows is called one
coulomb (C).
But, the authentic way to understand the coulomb is to understand the amount
of charge of an electron or proton. Its amount is:

Charge of electron : —1.6 x 107° C

Charge of proton : +1.6 x 107° C
You can see, if ¢, and g, both are positive or negative, then the value of I is
positive and they will repel one another. If one charge is positive and the other is
negative, then the value of F will be negative, which means the direction of the
force is changed, that is, the charges will attract one another. We have seen this
earlier and now the formula shows this too.

Question: A +1 C charge and a -1 C charge are placed at a distance of 10 cm.

The mass of an electron is 9.11 x 10731 kg, so the mass of all electrons:

So, if we can keep 324 kg electrons both in earth surface and in moon, the moon
would come out of its orbit. (The mass of a moderate cow!)
10.5 Electric Field
The force between two charges can be determined by using Coulomb's formula.
You may remember, for gravitational force, we have determined gravitational
acceleration without beginning from gravitational force separately. Multiplying
that acceleration with mass, we determine force.
In case of electric force, we can do that, we can define a new quantity called
electric field. Multiplying charge ¢ with this, we will get the force F acting on it.
Therefore, any charge g creates an electric field around it. That electric field E
is:
q


--- Page 289 ---
284 Physics
If any charge ¢ is brought in this electric field, then it will feel F force on it and
the magnitude of F will be,

F=Eq

As force F is a vector and charge q is a scalar, so, £ itself is a vector and its unit

is N/C. You will see, this topic is easier to explain with the help of electric fields.

Electric field cannot be seen, but to make it easy to understand, sometimes one

type of completely imaginary

lines are drawn, called the

electric lines of force (first

introduced by Michael —

Faraday). Our known world is 4

three dimensional, so the lines

of force will spread in all

directions. To show you, these . oo i

are drawn in a plane (Fig Figure 10.11: Lines of force diverges from

10.11). positive charge and converges into negative

There are some rules of charge

drawing lines of forces:

(a) In case of positive charge the lines of forces emerges from positive charges,
and in case of negative charge converges into negative charges . In a specific
point, the direction of tangent line of force is the direction of electric field.

(b) The more the amount of charge, per unit volume or area the more the number
of lines of forces.

(c) The nearer the lines of force, the more the magnitude of the electric field.

(d) The lines of force of one charge never intercept the lines of force of another
charge.

In Figure 10.12 (a), the lines of force of two opposite charges are shown. You

can see, the lines of force of one charge ended up in another charge. Where the

magnitude of the electric field is higher, the number of lines of force is higher.

Also, when the figure is seen, it gives a feeling that the two charges are

attracting one another. In Figure 10.12 (b), both the charges are positive and

from the figure it can be seen that, the two charges are repelling one another. Not

only that, in the middle portion of two charges the electric field due to one

charge is neutralized by the electric field of the other. As a result the number of

lines of force is less, and there is a point in the middle where the magnitude of 8

Therefore, to bring a test charge q from a distance r; along a straight line,
work has to be done against the repulsive force. The closer the charge q, is
brought to charge q, the greater the repulsive force it will feel, and thus more
work must be done. According to Coulomb's law, if the distance between
charges q and q, is infinite, there will be no force acting between them.
If work W is done in bringing an extremely small positive test charge q,, at con-
stant velocity, from an infinite distance to a distance r from the charge q, then
the work done per unit test charge is called the electric potential V of charge q at
that point. The potential is expressed as:

10.6.1 Potential Difference
You have likely noticed various warnings on electric lines, such as "Danger: Ten
Thousand Volts." Electric shock is a serious and potentially life-threatening
hazard; there have been many instances where careless individuals have lost
their lives due to electric shocks. If you grasp the concept of electrical potential,
you can better understand what occurs in these situations. When you encounter a
high potential and touch it, a charge will flow from that higher potential to your
body, as your body's potential is lower. The amount of charge that flows depends
on various factors within your own body.
The potential of the object you touch can be either positive or negative. In one
scenario, electrons may leave your body, while in another, they may enter
it—Dboth scenarios represent electric current, just in opposite directions.
It's crucial to recognize that charge flows due to the difference in potentia not the
value of the potential itself. For example, a crow perched on a high-voltage elec-
tric wire does not suffer an electric shock because its potential matches that of
the wire, resulting in no difference. Similarly, workers can safely perform
Ps


--- Page 294 ---
Static Electricity 289
tasks with bare hands on extremely high voltages, such as ten thousand or twenty
thousand volts, while suspended in a helicopter. They do not receive electric
shocks because their body's voltage aligns with that of the wire they are touch-
ing. In this case, there is no voltage difference, so no charge flows, and thus, they
remain unharmed.

This illustrates that the voltage difference is what truly matters, not the absolute
value of the voltage itself—a vital concept for everyone to understand.
However, when it comes to measuring voltage levels, it is useful to have a
specific reference voltage. In everyday life, we consider the Earth to have zero
potential. The Earth is so immense that adding or removing a small amount of
charge does not affect its potential. Consequently, all measurements are made
relative to this zero potential. You may have noticed that heavy electrical equip-
ment is consistently well-grounded (Earthing). This grounding ensures that if a
significant amount of charge unexpectedly enters the system—due to an acci-
dent, for example—it can quickly and safely discharge into the ground, minimiz-
ing the risk of harm to nearby individuals.

10.7 Capacitor

When a conductor is charged or electricity is applied to it, it attains an equipoten-
tial state. Furthermore, bringing another charged object near a conductor will
induce a charge on that conductor. The potential of a conductor depends on the
charges around it. When heat is applied to a material, the resulting temperature
change depends on its specific heat capacity. If the heat capacity is high, the tem-
perature will increase only slightly, even with substantial heat input; conversely,
a substance with a low heat capacity will experience a significant rise in tempera-
ture with minimal heat added.

Similarly, when a charge is introduced to a system of conductors, the resulting
increase in potential depends on the characteristics of that system. This charac-
teristic is known as the capacitance of the conductive system, commonly referred
Forma-37, Physics, Class 9-10


--- Page 295 ---
290 Physics
to as a capacitor. A capacitor with high capacitance requires a large amount of
charge to produce only a small increase in potential, while a capacitor with low
capacitance will see a significant rise in potential with just a small amount of
charge. For example, if a spherical capacitor has a capacitance C and receives a
charge Q, then its potential V is given by:

10.8 Uses of Static Electricity

‘We use electricity in our daily life, in industries, laboratories, educational insti-

tutions and hospitals etc. But we use current electricity (we will discuss it in the

next chapter) in almost all of these cases. But static electricity is also used in

some special cases:

All of us have used a photocopy machine now and then to copy some writing. In

this machine, light is projected on the paper which creates an image of the

writings on a special kind of roller. Static charges are created on the roller

similar to the writings on the paper. After that, the roller is brought in contact

with very fine powder like ink, and black ink is absorbed at the parts of the roller

where charges are formed. Then this ink is imprinted on a new white page. The

ink is attached very well to the paper by heating so that the ink doesn't scatter,

and the process work in this way.

10.8.2 Van de Graaff Machine

Different types of work are done with high voltage. This can be done with a Van

de Graaff machine using static electricity. Static charges are sprayed on a

rotating insulating belt, by rotating the

belt it is taken inside a metallic sphere IP slit ty

(Figure 10.17). A tangent (comb of + +

sharp needle) receives the charge from Thy tangent We

above the belt and sends it to the + Za +20 +

metallic sphere. We know, charge + (Q=27)) +

always flows from higher potential to + +

lower potential. It always happens in hy rs

the Van de Graaff generator, because 2 0 H+

inside the metallic sphere the potential metallic | H

is equal to the potential of the surface. sphere + static charge

The excess voltage that is created on + spray

the belt due to the excess charge on the none] ~ LH

belt, is always higher than the voltage belt =

of the sphere. Due to this reason, any ui

charge inside the sphere goes to the i i
=o surface of the sphere. In this process, Figure 10.17: Van de Graaff Machine


--- Page 297 ---
292 Physics
by accumulating huge amount of charge on the sphere it is possible to develop
high potential.

10.8.3 Fuel Truck

‘When petrol or other fuel trucks supply fuel, then they have to be very careful so
that no electrical sparks are created suddenly which may produce a big
explosion. This may happen if static electricity is generated due to friction
between truck wheels and the road. So behind the truck, a metal chain hangs
from the tank and stays in contact with the ground. In this way, any static
electricity produced is directly transferred to the earth through the chain.

10.8.4 Electronics

In cold countries, the amount of water vapor in air is very low and the effects of
static electricity are very high. Many types of IC (Integrated Circuit) are used
while working with electronics. Some IC’s can be damaged by even a slightest
change of voltage to their pins. That is why a touch of the hand while working
with electronics can damage a valuable IC or the circuit board. For doing work
under these circumstances, the upper part of a table is connected to the ground
with a conducting wire. Simultaneously, the hands of the person working are
connected to the ground using an electrical conducting strap.

10.8.5 Lightning and Lightning Arrestor

When water vapor rises to form clouds, the negative charges (electrons) created
due to friction between water vapor are stored in the lower altitude clouds. So
naturally a shortage of electrons is developed in the higher clouds making them
positively charged. When a large amount of charge is accumulated in the clouds,
a huge spark is formed inside the clouds to return to neutral state (which we
know as lightning). Sometimes so much charge is accumulated in the clouds that
they ionize the air and literally travels to the ground. We call that a thunderbolt.
A huge amount of charge is brought to the earth during a thunderbolt. It ionizes
the air while travelling through it, so a huge amount of heat, light and sound is
produced, and such amounts of charge can cause serious harm to the places
nearby.


--- Page 298 ---
Static Electricity 293
Millions of amperes of electric current can flow during a thunderbolt and for this
flow of current, the temperature of the air can rise up to 20-30 thousand degree
Celsius which is even more than the temperature of the sun!
For this temperature we see a bluish white sparkling in the sky. Another thing
occurs due to this temperature; the air expands to a great extent and moves
outside, and in the very next moment air from the outside fills in that blank space
created. This whole thing occurs faster than the speed of sound and an incredibly
loud noise is created. When the speed of air exceeds that of sound, it is called a
shockwave. The sound of a thunderbolt is a kind of shockwave. Although the
flashing of light and sound are created at the same time, we see the light first,
since the speed of light is so much that it reaches us within the next moment. The
speed of sound is 330 m/s which means it takes 3 s for it to travel one kilometer.
That is why; we can guess the distance at which the lightning is created by
calculating how many seconds later we hear the sound of thunder. Roughly
3 seconds for a kilometer.
Since electric current flows down from the clouds during a lightning, it usually
strikes tall structures. So to protect tall buildings from thunderbolts, more than
one pointy metal needle is set up on the roof. This current is then transferred to
the ground by some heavy conducting wires. The science behind this is very
simple. We have seen earlier that when a charged object is brought near an
uncharged body, the uncharged body becomes induced by opposite charge. So
while the possibility of a thunderbolt occurs, the pointy needles become
positively charged and an intense electric field is created due to pointy needles.
The surrounding air and water vapors become ionized due to this electric field
and these rises above and neutralizes the negative charges of clouds and reduces
the possibility of being a thunderbolt. When thunder needles are kept on the roof
of a tall building they often absorb the thunderbolt and the bar carries the huge
amount of charges directly to the ground. So the current coming down from the
sky doesn’t go to the ground uncontrolled; rather it goes to the deep ground
through the heavy wire.

14

BS


--- Page 299 ---
294 Physics
Not only thunderbolt occurs in the pointy needles, but also the needles can pass
opposite charges to neutralize the charges stored in the clouds. That is why,
when lightning arresters are installed in tall buildings, the risk of that building
being thunderstruck is reduced greatly.
10.8.6 Static Electric Color Spray
Static electric color sprays are used now-a-days to paint cars, bicycles, steel
cupboards and other metallic things. In these sprays very small particles of
colors are created and since they are charged, while getting out one particle
repels another particle and spreads out. So a large space can be smoothly painted
using spray.
To charge the color particles, the pointy head of the spray is connected with a
high potential source. The thing to be charged is connected with the opposite
potential or the earth. As the color particles are charged, they are attracted
towards the body and firmly attached with the body. Not only that, the color
particles can travel along electric lines of force and can reach the hidden corners
and create a layer of paint in there.
2) Investigation 10.01
Friction and induction

Objective: To create charges from friction and induction

Apparatus: Comb, aluminium foil.

Theory: While combing hair in winter, negative charges get stored in

the comb.

Working Procedure:

1) Take a very small piece of aluminium foil and roll it into a ball.

2) After combing the hair, bring the comb close to the aluminium foil

ball. If enough negative charges are accumulated on the comb, it will

induce a positive charge at the front side of the ball. (Since aluminium

foil is a conductor, the electrons in front will easily move back.) The

front side will be attracted by the comb and the ball will jump and

stick to the comb. 8

get absorbed immediately and will fall down being repelled by the
comb.

11.1 Electric current
We have discussed in the previous chapter that if two bodies have a
potential difference, then charge flows from the body of higher potential to
the body of lower potential. The flow of charges continues until the
potential becomes equal. This flow of charge is the flow of current or
electricity, which we generally call “electricity”. Using this electricity,
lights turn on, the fan rotates, and the phone charges!
A B A B
Figure 11.01: Electricity flows from a charged sphere to an uncharged sphere.
11.1.1 Electromotive Force and Potential Difference
You can understand that electricity flows only if there is a potential
difference. If we want to get a continuous flow of electricity, we have to
always maintain a potential difference and cannot let it be equal. If
potential is created using a positive charge in a sphere and then connecting
it with another uncharged sphere (Figure 11.01) by a metal wire, as the
electricity starts flowing, the potential difference will start decreasing and
the potentials will become equal! It is possible to develop a potential
difference between the two plates of a capacitor by accumulating charges
there. But if the plates of the capacitor are connected with a wire, the
potentials will become equal due to flow of charge.
So you can understand that if we want a continuous flow of electricity, we
need some other process which will maintain a potential difference that
will not decrease with the flow of charges. All of you have seen such
5 technique; these are battery cells or generators. Potential difference is
BS


--- Page 307 ---
302 Physics
produced by a chemical reaction inside the battery cell, if the flow of
charge starts, chemical substances start decreasing. When chemical
substances are finished, battery cells cannot create a flow of electricity.
The ordinary battery cells that we see regularly have a potential difference
of 1.5 volt.
For the supply of electricity that you have in your school or residence,
there are two points for using it, one of them is at higher potential and the
other one is at lower potential. This difference in potential is maintained by
a generator, which develops this continuously. A battery cell or a generator
has to send charges continuously from low potential to high potential for
continuous flow of electricity, and for that it needs energy. If # amount of
work is done to bring QO amount of charge from low potential to high
potential in a battery, then the electromotive force or e.m.f of the battery
* EMF = w

TQ
A battery cell or a generator which supplies electric energy has an
electromotive force or emf. When a battery cell or a generator is connected
to a circuit, this electromotive force brings the charge through the whole
circuit.
The amount of potential a battery +15V -15V
produces is its electromotive force or emf. i |
In English it is called “force” but in
Bengali it is “energy”. Actually, this emf 1 1
or electromotive force is not force or allie 1

Answer: This is shown in Figure 11.03.
11.1.2 Conductor, Insulator and Semiconductor
Conductor: If we have understood the structure of matter properly, then we
have understood one thing clearly. In solids the atoms and molecules strongly
hold their own positions. If temperature is increased the atoms or molecules start
vibrating, staying at their own position, and don’t move away from their
positions. When you learnt metallic bonds in your chemistry book, you have
seen , some electrons of metal atoms are in a free state which can move from one
place to another. For this reason, those are called conductors. Gold, silver,
«copper, aluminum etc. are good conductors. Charge can be transferred through
S conductors, but we have to remember that this transfer of charge is done by


--- Page 309 ---
304 Physics
electrons; flow of electricity is done by electron, negatively charged electrons!
Insulator: The substance which has no free electron for conducting electricity is
called an insulator. Plastic, rubber, wood, glass are examples of insulators.
Mainly, non-metals are insulators.
Semiconductor: There are some substances whose conductivity lies between
insulators and conductors at normal temperature, but their conductivity
increases with the rise of temperature. These types of substances are called
semiconductors. Silicon or germanium examples of semiconductors.
Semiconductor are elaborately discussed in the last chapter of this book.
11.1.3 Direction of electric flow
We have seen that if two bodies of different potentials are connected by a
conductor, charge starts flowing and it continues until the potentials become
equal and we say electric current is flowing. Many of you may have started
thinking because when we talked about equalizing two different potentials by
flow of charge, we said that it is true for negative charges, as only negatively
charged electrons can go from one place to another. Then what happens in case
of positive charge? As the positive ions are strongly bounded in their own
positions, how does positive charge move from one place to another?
You may have already realized what happens in that case. The deficiency of
electron is positive charge. So increasing the deficiency by moving electrons
means a supply of positive charge! So, if it is said that in Figure 11.01 positive
charge moves from A to B by flow of electricity, actually it means that electrons
move from B to A.
The flow of charge is electric current. So far, we have tried to understand it
normally. Let us specify it a little bit now. Electric current means the rate of
change of flow of charge with respect to time i.e. if OQ charge flows in time t, the
electric current is:
I= Q
t
3


--- Page 310 ---
Current Electricity 305
If the unit of charge is the Coulomb (C) and of time is second (t), then the unit
of electric current is ampere A. Interesting thing is, to find the unit of charge we
said, if one ampere electric current flows for one second then the amount of
charge that flows is called 1 Coulomb. Electric current is the rate of flow of
charge; if 1 ampere current flows from A to B, it means 1 coulomb positive
charge has been moved from A to B. Which actually means that the amount of
electrons equivalent to 1 Coulomb charge has been moved from B to A.
Therefore, you see that the direction of electric current is opposite to the
direction of flow of electrons. (All problems could have been solved if we
assume the charge of electron is positive, but it has been too late!)
11.2 Relationship between Potential Difference and Electricity
Now we will discuss actual flow of current in a real circuit. We have said before
that if there is a potential difference between two points and if we connect these
two points with a conducting wire, electric current will start flowing between the
points, though we haven't discussed the amount of electric current. Not only that,
will the amount of current that flows if the connection is made by a gold wire be
equal to the current that will flow through the connection made by an iron wire?

will be 2x1.5 =3V, for three cells it
will be 3x1.5 = 4.5 V. We can apply Figure 11.04: Current flow relative to
different potential differences in potential difference due to resistance

--- Page 311 ---
306 Physics
flows, we will see that
a) The higher the potential difference the higher the current flow.
b) If potential difference is negative, the electric current also changes
direction.
If we put the result of the experiment on a graph, it will be like figure 11.04 (a):
Therefore,
TV
If we do the same experiment by using a wire of some other materials, we will get
similar results. But the slope of the straight line may be different. (Figure
11.04(b)) Now if we analyze the results of these two experiments, we will
understand that for a certain potential difference, the current that flows through
the first conductor is more than the current that flows through the second
conductor for the same potential difference. It is as if the flow of current is easier
through the first conductor and a little difficult through the second one. To
explain the matter, a quantity named ‘resistance to current flow” or simply
‘resistance’ has been introduced. We can see that the relation between voltage
and electric current can be expressed by a law which is known as Ohm’s law.
LY
“Rr
So, the higher the resistance, the lower is the electric current. And the lower the
resistance, the higher is the current.
The unit of resistance is Ohm and it is expressed by the Greek letter Q. If 1 V
potential difference is applied in an electric circuit and if it is seen that 1 A
current flows as a result, it can be said that the resistance of the circuit is 1 Q.

11.2.2 Resistance
Resistance is the obstacle to the flow of current. So the more the length of a
material L, the higher is the hindrance, and resistance.

path. So, the higher the cross sectional area 4 of a conductor, the lower is the

We have to remember one thing; the resistance of a substance is the hindrance
to electron flow.
The more the atoms and molecules vibrate the more the barrier the electrons will
face while going through them. In other words, the more the resistance. As the
vibrations of the atoms and molecules increases with the increase in
temperature, so the specific resistance of a conducting substance also increases
with temperature. So the temperature has to be specifically mentioned while
expressing resistance or specific resistance of a substance.
Fixed Resistance: Resistors with a definite value are used in different circuits.
They can be of different shapes and of different types. The resistances that are
used in laboratory uses, generally the value of the resistances are expressed by
using bands of different colors on them. How much electric power they can
tolerate is also specified along with the value of the resistance.

If the temperature of a conductor is raised, its resistance increases, but the case
is the opposite for a semiconductor. The resistance decreases if the temperature
goes up in a semiconductor. The reason is, there are free electrons in a conductor
for the flow of current, but a semiconductor does not have free electrons. If the
temperature is raised, some electrons are found for the flow of current, so a
temperature rise causes the decrease of resistance of a semiconductor.
11.2.3 Circuit
If we have understood Ohm's law, we should be able to analyse circuits now.
Before that, let us introduce some of the symbols that are used in circuits:
(Figure 11.07)
Every substance has some resistance, but we do not consider the resistance of
electrical wires while using them in circuits in our daily life. When a resistance
is needed, we use different resistances prepared in special ways. Sometimes we
use such resistances for some special purposes, where even their magnitudes
can be changed, these are called variable resistance or rheostat. -

312 Physics
Now we are ready to analyse a circuit. We may think that we have understood
the circuit completely if we can find out the potential difference in any part of
the circuit and how much current is flowing through that part. There may be
many components in a circuit like battery cell, resistance, capacitor, diode,
transistor etc. But now we will analyze the circuit composed of only the battery
cell and resistance. In a circuit, resistances are connected with copper wires,
though we have seen that copper wire has a specific resistance. But in reality, the
resistance of the connecting wires is very small with respect to the resistances
we use in a circuit, so , we do not consider it at all. We will assume that the wire
has no resistance and the potential is the same over the whole wire.
Now, let us analyse a circuit as shown in figure 1 1.08(a), here, a resistance is
connected to the two terminals of a battery cell with two wires. Since the part CD
is connected to the earth, so we can say that the potential of the lower terminal
of the battery cell is zero. So, the upper terminal of the battery has a potential V
and there is a resistance in part BC, potential difference between two ends of the
resistance is,
V-0=V
If the resistance is R, the current I flowing through it will be,
I 14

So, current I comes out from point A of the battery and enters into point B. We
have determined the voltage and current at every point of the circuit.
Let us assume in the same circuit, if we connect AB part with the earth rather
than part DC (Figure 11.08(b)) what will happen then? As the voltage of the
battery cell is V volt, so the potential difference between A and D must be V, as
the voltage of A is zero, so the voltage of D must be -V. Therefore, the potential
difference between B and C has to be,

What may be the voltage at E, how can it be determined, many of us may be
confused about this. Actually the case is very simple. When current flows
through a resistance, the voltage changes. There is no chance of current flow in
this part BE of the circuit. It can go nowhere after reaching E starting from B.
So, the voltage at B and E (and any point between them) does not change, the
voltage at B remains the same at E.
To determine the voltages of B and E, the current has to be determined. If
current is I, then i v_ 6V 1 \

So, voltage difference from A to B, 1

Vi=RI=5QxZA=1V
So, the voltage at A is 6V and 1V less at B so, the voltage at B is,
6V-V,=6V—-1V=5V
As the voltage of point B is 5 V, then the voltage of point E is also 5 V. Similarly,

Va = Ry =10Qxz A =2V
The voltage at C is 2 V less than voltage of point B. So, voltage of point C is,

The voltage of point D is less than point C by V,.

11.2.4 Equivalent Resistance: Series Circuit
If there is more than one resistance in a circuit, we will see how these resistances
can be considered as a single equivalent
resistance. In figure 11.11 there are two A By 3
resistances in the circuit, as C is connected to
the ground so it’s potential is zero and
the potential of A is V. We don’t know the V 1 Ra

amount of electric current I flows through R
and R,. = c

Figure 11.12: Many successive resistances or resistors connected in
a circuit can be imagined as an equivalent resistance or resistor.
If there were more than two resistances (figure 11.12) then also we would be able
to show that these resistances can be combined as a single resistance R which
will be the sum of all those resistances. This is called the equivalent resistance.
This means when a circuit will have R , R,, R, ... resistances successively (series
circuit) then the equivalent resistance will be:
R=R, +Ry+Rs+..+R,
11.2.5 Equivalent resistance: Parallel circuit
Now we will place the resistances in parallel instead of one after another (Figure
11.13). In this circuit we have named different points as A, B,C, DD, E and
F. We can understand from the figure that points D, E and F are connected to the
ground and so their potentials are zero. So the potential of points A, B,and Cis

11.3 Electric Power
When discussing potential, we saw that if a charge is moved by applying
a potential then some work is done or some energy is lost. So if V potential is
applied to move a charge Q in a circuit then the amount of work done (or the
applied energy) is W =VvQ Joule
Power P is the capacity of work done per second, so if Q charge is moved in ¢

If electricity flows through a resistance for time ¢, then Pt energy is supplied there.
Where does this energy go? When you use a resistance in a circuit and if you
pass enough electricity through this resistance, then you will notice that it
always gets hot. That means the electrical energy evolves as heat energy.
The use of bulbs with filaments are getting scarce, because the filament has to be
heated to create light with this. A big part of the electric energy is used to heat up
the filament, and energy is wasted. If we touch these bulbs with our hand we can
feel how much heat energy is created, and this energy is created as °R or V*/R in
every second.
This is not the only place where the electrical energy is used to create heat ~<

consumed
VI. Every house has an electric meters. It continuously measures potential
(¥) and what amount of current is flowing (7). From there it can determine how
much electrical energy (P=VI) is provided in each second in the house.
Multiplying this with the total time we can find the total electrical energy spent.
The conventional unit of electrical energy spent is kilowatt-hour (kW-h). This
unit is called Board of Trade Unit (BOT) or briefly, Unit. The electric bill we pay
is calculated in this unit.

--- Page 325 ---
320 Physics
Answer: We know, spent energy = (P x t) /1000 kilowatt-hour or unit
P=60W and t= 5x30 hour

Spent energy = 60 x (5 x 30)/1000 unit=9 unit
Total cost of electricity with 10 taka per unit = 9 x 10 taka = 90 taka
11.4 Electrical Supply
When current needs to be transmitted from one place to another in a country, it
is transformed into a very high voltage. This is done to reduce the loss of
electricity in electrical wires. You know that, the amount of energy wasted per
second as heat energy is equal to 2R , so we may conclude that there would be
no dissipation of energy as heat energy if there was no resistance R in electrical
wires.
But that is not practically possible; everything has some resistance. That is why,
if current I can be reduced, the energy lost /2R due to heat can also be reduced.
Since the amount of electrical energy supplied per second is VI, if the
potential is increased by 10 times, it is possible to supply the same energy using
10 times less current. If 10 times less current is supplied, 100 times less heat
energy will be dissipated. This is because the resistance R of the wire is the same
in both cases.
Now you may think that the loss of heat energy can also be written as /*/R and
in that case the heat energy loss will be 100 times due to 10 times increase of
voltage. It is to be remembered that when we found the energy loss per second
as V%/R, we then saw V was the potential difference between the two sides of the
resistance. The ¥ which we are discussing here is not the potential difference
between the two sides of the wire. It is the value of potential of the electric wire!
The value of the potential on two sides of the electrical wire is almost equal. So
the difference is negligible.
11.4.1 System Loss of Electricity
We know that the power plants situated at different parts of the country produce
electricity. This electricity is to be transmitted to different of the country. To
distribute electricity, first it is transmitted to the substations of different areas.
The electrical energy is then distributed to consumers using electricity 3
distribution systems. h


--- Page 326 ---
Current Electricity 321
The conducting wires that are used to carry electricity from one place to other
have at least some minimum resistance. When current (/) flows through a
resistance (R), heat (IR) is generated and this is loss of electrical energy. This
loss is called system loss. We have already discussed that if electricity is
supplied at high voltage then for a definite electrical energy, loss is reduced
because of resistive heat energy. That is why electricity produced in the power
plants is transformed into high voltage using step up transformers. Before
distributing the electrical energy for customer use, the electrical supply is again
brought down to a suitable voltage using a step down transformer.

11.4.2 Load Shedding

Each power plant produces a definite amount of electric energy and electricity
produced in all power stations is added to the national grid. We have discussed
carlier that electricity is distributed to consumers from local substations. The
national grid supplies electricity as per the needs of different areas. If the
demand of electricity in an area is more than the electricity produced, then
naturally the required electricity cannot be supplied in that area. Then the
substations are forced to keep electricity supply off in one area to be able to
supply electricity to another area. This process is called load shedding. When the
substation gets the required electricity supply again, it distributes electricity to
that area again.

If load shedding is to be done for several hours at a stretch, to make load
shedding tolerable, the authority load sheds in a rotation, in different areas at
different times.

11.5 Safe Use of Electricity

We cannot think of a moment without electricity. Electricity brings light to our
house, keeps us cool in the summer by using fans. We watch television and use
computers using electricity. Electricity runs fridges that preserve food. We use
it to iron clothes. When the charge of mobiles gets low, we use electricity to
charge the battery. Rich people use AC in their houses, washing machines to
wash clothes, and electric heaters to cook. They prepare warm meals by heating
using microwave ovens.

We can go on telling all day about the uses of electricity in our houses, schools,
colleges, fields, farms, industries and hospitals etc. In our country, generally
220V (AC) electricity is supplied, which can give electric shock to people and
Forma-41, Physics, Class 9-10


--- Page 327 ---
322 Physics
may even cause death from those shocks. That is why all electrical appliances
are made in such a way that no one comes in direct contact with those things.

If electricity passes directly through the heart then only 10 mA of current can
cause death. The electricity we use for different purposes is AC. The resistance
of dry skin of human beings is around 100,000 © which decreases by a thousand
times when

it gets wet. So from Ohm’s law we can show that the 220 V electricity of our
country can easily produce fatal current flows. A person with a wet feet standing
on a wet floor has the worst possible condition of getting an electric shock.
When a person is electrocuted, he can’t move hands and legs because of the
current flowing through his body. As a result, in spite of having the sense to
move away from the dangerous condition, he or she won’t be able to do it.

The electricity we use can be dangerous, but if we follow some general
precautions we can safely use electricity, and millions of people around the
world are doing so. We should know the following for safe use of electricity:

(a) Electrically insulated cover: Open wire carrying electricity is dangerous,
so it is always covered with plastic or another insulator. If short circuit occurs for
any reason i.e. positive and negative wires touches without any resistance then,
according to Ohm’s law, a large amount of current flows, the wire become
heated, the plastic burns and can even cause fire. So it should be taken care that
insulating layer remains unaltered and intact.

(b) Better Connection: The electrical connections should be made correctly
where electrical equipment run using huge amount of electricity. If the
connections are not properly done, extra resistance is produced and according to
FR, it may be heated, may burn the insulating layer, and can damage the
electrical connection.

(¢) Humidity: Water is conductor of electricity, so if water enters any circuit, it
may be dangerous due to short circuit. A hair drier or electric iron is very
dangerous to use near water, because if it falls suddenly in the water and anyone
touches it, an accident may occur by electrocuting the person.

(d) Circuit breaker and fuse: Major accidents of electricity occur when a
large amount of current flows suddenly due to some defects. To stop sudden
large flows, circuit breakers or fuses are used. A circuit breaker is made in such
away that if a large amount of current flows (more than the safer level), it breaks
the circuit. A fuse is a comparatively simple method; the amount of current that ~~ §

8


--- Page 328 ---
Current Electricity 323
flows through equipment is passed through a thin wire before entering the
equipment. The thin wire (where the resistance is more, so °R is more i.e. more
heat) of the fuse becomes heated and burnt, and stops the supply of electricity if
for any reason excess current tries to flow.
(e)Flow less connection: There are always two wires in an electric supply line,
one with high potential (Live) and another is voltage less neutral (Neutral).
live live
®P pA
neutral neutral
Figure 11.15: Wrong and correct connection of switch.
When a machine is used, then starting from the live wire the electricity passes
through the machine and then returns to the source through the neutral
wire. A voltage less neutral wire is safe, but a high voltage wire should be used
cautiously. When a switch is used to connect electricity to a machine, it can be
connected with a high voltage wire or a neutral wire. It is wise to connect the
switch with the high voltage wire (Figure 11.15). Then high voltage enters the
machine only when the switch is on. When the switch is off, there is no high
voltage inside the machine.
(f) Ground: You may have noticed that there are at least two connections in an
electric supply in school or at home, high voltage and neutral. But if an
expensive machine (e.g. computer, fridge) is connected to the current, you will
see that besides high potential and neutral, there is another third connection,
which is the ground. Generally this is connected to the body or cover of the
machine. If the machine is electrified accidentally, then current directly flows
from the cover or body to ground. A fuse burns due to this flow of electricity and
., makes the machine safe. So, if anyone accidentally touches it, he is not
g electrocuted.

11.6 Design of Circuit in Residence
What a circuit should be like for supplying electricity in a household is shown
in Figure 11.17. Electricity is supplied at home from a power station through a
supply cable. Between them, one is live; another is neutral. The live line has high
voltage, the neutral has zero voltage. The live line is marked red and the neutral
line is marked blue in the figure. It first passes through an electric meter. This
meter records how much electricity is consumed. After the meter, it is supplied
through a consumer unit.
Three circuit breaker or fuse of 5A, 15A and 30A is shown in Figure 11.17.
These three circuit breakers are connected to the main switch. The electric =

15A is connected with cooking burner. 30A circuit breaker is connected to the
plug points of the house. We have certainly noticed that this part is like a ring
which means flow of current can be through two different paths. In this part the
ground is shown differently (green color).

completely different topics, these are two different forms of the same energy, that
will be discussed in this chapter. We will see that as electric current can produce
a magnetic field, similarly a varying magnetic field can also produce an electric
current.
In this chapter along with the magnetic effects of current, we will discuss how

12.1: Magnet
All of you have seen a magnet. If a magnet is brought close to iron like materials,
then it attracts the iron. There is nothing visible between the magnet and iron but
an invisible force is pulling it. When observing that for the first time, one kind
of surprise is developed in all.
Those of you who have played the magnets must have noticed (Figure 12.01)
that there are two poles of a magnet. The similar poles repel, while the dissimilar
poles attract each other.
“ os
7 Co
Figure 12.01: Dissimilar poles of a magnet attract, and similar poles repel.
The poles are generally named the north and south poles.
If a bar magnet is suspended freely, it always points towards the north-south
direction.
The pole which directs towards the north direction is called the north pole, and
the pole which directs towards the south is called the south pole. This occurs due
to the fact that the earth itself has a magnetic field; when a magnet is suspended;
the magnet aligns itself along that field.
We can discuss how two magnets attract one another. But first we have to know
from where the force of a magnet comes.
12.2: Magnetic Effects of Current
Those of you who have handled magnets cannot imagine that it is not different
from electricity, and a magnet can be made by electricity or flow of charges! a

it.
Let us assume that a wire penetrates through the middle of a cardboard
and some small compasses are placed on the cardboard around the wire. The
compasses will be aligned along north-south direction. Now if a current
(moderately strong) passes through the wire, you will surprisingly notice that
suddenly the compasses are arranging themselves one after another. You will get
an impression that a circular magnetic field around the wire has been generated
due to the electric current.

Now, if the current is stopped, then again the compasses align along the
north-south direction. If the direction of current is changed, you will find that the
compasses will arrange themselves again, but now the direction of the
compasses in the circle will be reversed. This is because the current always
produces a magnetic field around it in a definite direction.
If current flows through a conducting wire, then the direction of the magnetic
lines of force produced due to this can be obtained from the right hand rule. If
the thumb indicates the direction of current, then the other fingers will indicate
the direction of the magnetic field ( Figure 12.03).

is is shown in Figure 12.05. You are able to understand that the more the
current, the stronger the magnetic field is. There is a limit to how much current
can be pass through a wire, since the wire is heated as I°R. Moreover, the
maximum amount of current that can pass through a wire depends on the source
of electricity. Therefore if we want to produce a strong magnetic field, then
instead of making a single loop, a coil is made by a insulated wire, winding it =~ §

several times. This coil is called a solenoid. A strong magnetic field can be

generated by that coil. Every loop of the coil will create a magnetic field due to

the electric current flowing through it. So the combined magnetic field is

stronger.

the current through a loop.

If current flows through a circular coil, then the direction of its magnetic field

can also be found with the help of the right hand rule. The thumb indicates the

direction of the magnetic field, while the other fingers show the direction of the

current (Figure 12.06). A coil of wire or a solenoid behaves like a bar magnet,

and the direction of the thumb will be the north pole of this magnet.

12.2.2: Electromagnet

A more powerful magnetic field can be created if a piece of iron is inserted

inside a solenoid than the magnetic field that can be produced by using current

only. The three metals iron, cobalt and nickel have special magnetic properties.

These metallic pieces can be considered as an accumulation of individual tiny

magnets, which generally don’t act as a magnet as they are aligned in different

directions. These substances consist of an enormous number of small

magnets that are randomly oriented. Since the small magnets are randomly

oriented, the piece of iron does not act as a magnet.

But when this piece is kept inside a solenoid or a coil, and if current is passed
.. through the solenoid, then the magnetic field produced by that current aligns the
§ individual tiny magnets.

Therefore, the magnetic field produced by

similar poles repel. We also know

that a current carrying wire

Magnetic Effects of Current 337
If current flows through the wire (from bottom to up) that current will create a
circular magnetic field around it and thus rearrange the magnetic lines of force,
by combining with the magnetic field that goes from the north pole to the south
pole. At the bottom of the wire the lines of forces will be more and at the top of
the wire the lines of forces will be less, which will push the wire in upward
direction.
If the direction of current through the wire is reversed, then the direction of the
circular magnetic field will also be reversed. Then the density of the lines of
force at the top of the wire will be more and hence push the wire downward.

12.2.4 D.C Motor
You know that a magnet can be used to apply force on another magnet. In other
words, we can say a magnetic field can be used to apply force on another
magnetic field. Since a wire cannot carry very much current, it cannot produce a
strong magnetic field. That is why with the help of another magnetic field a
strong force cannot be applied on it. You have seen that if a coil of wire is made
winding many times and a piece of iron or armature is inserted into it, then by
passing a little amount of current through the wire, the coil becomes a strong
electromagnet that can create a very strong magnetic field. If we imagine the coil
is to be a bar magnet, and keep it in another magnetic field, then we can analyze
what kind of attractive or repulsive force it feels and also the direction of motion
due to it. In Figure 12.10, an electromagnet of this type is placed in another
magnetic field, and how it changes its position due to the repulsive force is
shown. If the electromagnet is allowed to rotate about an axis, passing through
its center, then it will try to go to a position like in the next figure.
Forma-43, Physics, Class 9-10


--- Page 343 ---
338 Physics
If we can make such a condition that as soon as the electromagnet reaches the
next position, the current passing through the electromagnet is changed, then
just after reaching there, the bar magnet made of coil alternates its polarities,
F——

in such a way that it can rotate always.
i.e. its north pole becomes the south pole and the south pole becomes north pole.
So due to repulsion, it will try to move again, i.e. it will experience a rotational
force. It will try to reach the next stable position, but just after reaching there if
the direction of the current is again changed, it will not stop there. Rather, it will
continue its rotation. That’s why, when it reaches one stable position, if current
in it flows in such a way that it
experiences a rotational force due to DO
repulsion, then it will continue to
rotate.
In order to change the direction of
current, we have to use a mechanical © Nl 5
technique with the help of a simple
device called a commutator. The two [S| LISS,
wires of the electromagnet are placed
on two sides of the rotating axis
around which the main coil rotates in
such a way that it touches two
terminals of the main electric current

terminals touch it, then it will flow the
current in such a way that it tries to . |

move away the electromagnet always
by repulsion. When it moves away from the terminals of the main current, no
current flows in the electromagnet, then it continues its rotation due to inertia of
motion. g


--- Page 344 ---
Magnetic Effects of Current 339
For your understanding, it is presented in a easy way (Figure 12.11). In a
practical motor, there may be many coils around the armature and each coil gets
current from the commutator and the armature continues its rotation.

12.3 Electromagnetic Induction

We see a lot of machines that rotates around us, it may seem to us that this is the
magnet and the biggest contribution of the magnetic field! Actually the biggest
contribution of magnets and magnetic fields is electromagnetic induction, that
is, the production of electricity with the help of magnetic fields.

Scientist Oersted first showed that if the magnetic field is changed through a
conducting loop, then an electromotive force is developed within the loop,
which can flow current through the loop. This property is used to build an
electric generator, where by changing the magnetic field through a conducting
loop, generates eleetricity.

If the two ends of a coil are connected

with an ammeter and a bar magnet is =H

inserted in it, then at the time of A

inserting the magnet we will see a Ld si

(Figure 12.11). When we will pull it wits

the opposite direction. If we change >

the pole of the magnet, then we will

see the change of direction of current

in the ammeter also! During the time

of changing the magnetic field in a Figure 12.12: When a magnet enters
coil of wire, the generation of voltage into a solenoid current is produced in it.
and current in the coil is called elec-

tromagnetic induction. This voltage is called induced voltage, and the current is
called induced current.


--- Page 345 ---
340 Physics
During this experiment, to change the magnetic field in the coil, we brought the
magnet towards the coil away from it. If we could change the magnetic field in
an other way, then we would observe the same thing.
Another way of changing the magnetic field in the coil is to bring another coil
near it (instead of bringing the magnet) and producing magnetic field in the
second coil by flowing current through it. If a battery and a switch are connected
with the second coil to produce magnetic field in it, then by turning the switch
‘on’, a magnetic field can be produced in the coil, again turning the switch “off”,
the magnetic field can be removed. Keeping the second coil near the first coil,
if a magnetic field is produced once in it and the magnetic field is removed
again, then the magnetic field will be changed in the first coil and due to this we
will see current in the ammeter! When current is produced by turning on the
switch, then the ammeter will show the presence of the current by deflecting its
needle in one direction. When the switch is turned off, the needle will deflect in
another direction, and show the current flowing in the opposite direction.
One thing we have to remember: when the magnetic field changes, only then
does the current flow. If a strong magnet is kept inside a coil, no current will
flow through the coil. Only by moving the coil, the magnetic field is changed,
then a current will flow through it.
12.3.1 Generator
When we were trying to understand how a motor works, we saw that a current
passes through an electromagnet in a magnetic field which cause it to rotate. Let
us see the matter in another way. If instead of giving connection of a battery cell
with two terminals of an electromagnet of a motor, we connect an ammeter there
and rotate the electromagnet. What will happen then?
Of course, the magnetic field within the coil will change, so a current will flow
through the coil. That is, the electromagnet of the motor that we have rotated by
passing current through it, if we rotate that electromagnet or coil, the reverse
thing happens, electricity is generated. In this way a generator is built.
Therefore, if we rotate the armature of a DC motor, we get DC electric current,
if AC motor is rotated it gives AC current.

12.3.2 Transformer

current— this property is used to J —
prepare transformer. In Figure L =
12.13 a rectangular iron core is 68 Zo

transformer works. Conducting =
wires have been winding on the
two sides of the core of course Figure 12.13: If AC potential is applied
there are insulating covers on the in primary coil of a transformer, it
conducting wires, so that if it produces potential in the secondary coil
touches anything metallic a short
circuit doesn’t occur. In the figure, we see that on the left side of the core an AC
voltage source is connected. Since the wire is connected by winding the iron
core, so when current will flow the core will be magnetized and the magnetic
lines of force will pass through the rectangular iron core.
Since we have connected AC voltage source, the magnetic strength inside the
core will increase or decrease and will change its direction, i.e. the magnetic field
will change continuously. On the other side of the iron core, there is wire winding
also (definitely covered with insulator). The magnetic field will change
continuously in that coil through the iron core, and this change will produce an
electromotive force (emf) in the coil of the right side. If we wish, we can see it
in a voltmeter. The transfer of electricity from one coil to another coil in this
process (directly, without any electrical connection) is called transformer.
We can do some amazing things with this transformer. If the number of turns of
both the coils is the same, then for a definite AC voltage applied in the left side
coil, we will get the same AC voltage in the right side coil. If the number of turns
on right side is ten times of that of the left side, then the voltage becomes ten
times. If the number of turns on the right side is ten times less, then the voltage
will be ten times less. The coil on the left side where AC voltage is applied is
called the primary coil and the right side coil (from where voltage is returned
back) is called the secondary coil. You may think that if it is possible to be
happened, then why don’t we arrange an enormous amount of electrical energy
by giving small numbers of turns and applying small voltage in the primary coil
and by giving much more turns in the secondary coil, and thus obtaining a much
higher voltage? We have to remember one thing: the amount of electrical energy
applied per second is measured by the formula VI (voltage x current). The

ed by ten times.
For your understanding, a rectangular core is shown. Practical transformers are
constructed a bit differently, the secondary coil is winded on the primary coil
and the core is also slightly different.
If the number of turns in the primary coil is n, and that of the secondary coil is
n, if AC voltage V, is applied in the primary coil, then the AC voltage V that
will be found in the secondary coil depends on number of turns.

The transformer has a greater number of turns in the secondary coil than the
primary coil and due to this, the AC voltage applied in the primary coil increases
in the secondary coil is called a step-up transformer. For transmission of
electricity, a step up transformer is used to increase the voltage by many times.
The transformer which has less turns in the secondary coil than the primary coil
and due to this, the AC voltage applied in the primary coil decreases in the
secondary coil. This is called a step down transformer.

of modern physics at the beginning of twentieth century. Radio activity is
described in this chapter.
Electronics is the main drive of our present civilization- this statement is not
exaggerated at all. The contribution of physics behind the present electronics has
been discussed in this chapter, and the instruments that have changed our lives

Radioactivity and Electronics 349
13.1 Radioactivity
We all know, there is a nucleus at the center of an atom, and there are protons and
neutrons in the nucleus. The number of revolving electrons around the nucleus
is equal to the number of protons in it. The radius of the nucleus is about one
lakh times smaller than the radius of the atom. But the actual mass of the atom is
the mass of its nucleus even though its size is small, because the mass of the
electron is 1836 times less than that of the proton or neutron.
A proton is positively charged, so the nucleus cannot be formed only with
protons because the protons will be thrown off due to strong repulsion force. So
there is charge-less neutrons with protons in the nucleus, and nuclei become
stable due to very strong nuclear force between neutrons and protons. Though
there is only one proton at the center of a normal hydrogen atom, there are also
hydrogen nuclei with one or two neutrons.
With the increase of the number of protons, to keep this nucleus stable, the
number of neutrons also increases. But when the proton number exceeds 82,
the nucleus starts to become unstable. But, no stable isotope is found for
Technetium (43) and Promethium (61).These unstable nuclei try to become stable
by emitting a kind of radiation. We call this process radioactivity. The radiation
that comes out from the nucleus is called a radioactive ray.
It is not the fact that when proton number exceeds 82 (atomic number more than 82)
only then the nucleus becomes radioactive. Any nucleus of other atoms may be
radioactive too. We have classified atoms on the basis of their electron number
which is equal to the number of protons. External properties, nature, chemical
properties; every feature of an element depends on the classification of
electrons. So the number of neutrons of an atom can be different even if the
number of electrons and protons is equal. These types of elements, with different
numbers of neutrons, are called isotopes of that element. So, an isotope of an
element may be stable, but another isotope of that element may be unstable or
., radioactive. For example, we can say that element carbon in whose nucleus there
S aresix protons and its three isotopes are:


--- Page 355 ---
350 Physics

Cy,: 6 protons and 6 neutrons

Cy5 : 6 protons and 7 neutrons

Cy: 6 protons and 8 neutrons
Among these three isotopes, C,, is unstable or radioactive.
In 1896, Henry Becquerel discovered the existence of radioactive rays from
Uranium for the first time. Later on, Ernest Rutherford, Pierre Curie, Marie
Curie and other scientists discovered radioactivity of other elements. Since
radioactivity it is not influenced by external pressure, heat, electric or magnetic
field, and cannot be controlled, it is accepted as a nuclear phenomenon. Due to
radioactivity, radioactive rays emerge and this changes the structure of the
nucleus and turn it into a different element, this is also observed.
The main three radioactive rays that emit from the nucleus are alpha, beta and
gamma rays (Figure 13.01).
13.1.1 Alpha ray
Alpha ray or alpha particle is actually a helium nucleus. A helium nucleus
contains two protons and two neutrons, so it is a charged particle. So its path of
motion can be influenced by electric and magnetic field. When an alpha particle
emits from a nucleus, it possesses some MeV of energy, so when it passes
through air and collides with the molecule -atoms it can ionize them intensively.
In air, the path of motion of an alpha particle is straight. Since an alpha particle
is a helium nucleus, it cannot travel far through air. It loses its energy by
ionizing air molecule-atoms ans travels approximately 6 cm through air before
stopping. An alpha particle can be stopped by using a sheet of paper. It creates
phosphorescence on zinc sulfide screen. An alpha particle creates many free
electrons by ionizing molecule-atoms of air in its path of motion. Its presence
can be detected or its energy can be measured easily by collecting these free
electrons.
When a alpha particle comes out from a larger radioactive nucleus then this
nucleus’s atomic number will be reduced by two and its nucleon number willbe
reduced by four, because an alpha particle consists of two protons and two ~~ &

Radioactivity and Electronics 351
neutrons. For example: an isotope of uranium turns into thorium by emitting an
alpha particle.
phap Uys — Thy, + Hey”
The atomic number of uranium is 92 and thorium is 90. It is notable that number
of electrons of an atom is not significant. Radioactive nuclei of atoms can
easily give up or receive extra electrons to and from its surroundings.

Figure 13.01: It is possible to stop an alpha particle by a single sheet of paper,
because it can lose its energy by too much ionizing. It is necessary to stop beta ray or
electrons using an aluminum sheet of a few millimeter thick. A thick lead sheet is
needed to stop gamma ray.

13.1.2 Betaray
A Beta particle is actually an electron (it is of courise a matter of wonder that a
nucleus is consists of neutrons and protons only, so how does an electron come
out from a nucleus?) For this, inside the nucleus a neutron has to dissociate into
a proton and an electron.
n> ptte + ¥
That is, a charge-less neutron is converted into a positively charged proton and a
negatively charged electron, so the total amount of charge remains unchanged.
In the right side of the equation, ( v) indicates the anti particle of a neutrino
(anti-neutrino), a mysterious particle of the world of physics, which is
“ . .
2S chargeless and its mass is very small.
BS


--- Page 357 ---
352 Physics
When an alpha particle is emitted from a nucleus, it comes out with a definite
amount of energy. But in the case of a beta particle, this is not true. The energy
of the beta particle depends on the part of the total energy radiation received by
the anti-neutrino.
Since a beta particle is negatively charged electron, it can be influenced by
electric and magnetic field. When it passes through matter, it can ionize the
molecule-atoms of the matter due to collision with them. Since the size of a beta
particle is much smaller than that of an alpha particle (helium nucleus), its
penetrating capability is more than the alpha particle and it can penetrate deeper
into matter. It is possible to stop a normal beta particle by a few millimeter thick
aluminum sheet.
‘When radiation of beta particles occurs, a proton is increased in the nucleus by
deducting of a neutron. So the number of nucleons remains the same. As the
atomic number depends on the number of protons, the atomic number of the
nucleus increases, and hence a different nucleus of a different element is formed.
For example: radioactive C , is converted into N,, due to beta radiation:

Ci; — Ny, + e + v (anti-neutrino)
An interesting matter is that, not only the emission of electrons is beta radiation
from inside the nucleus; the emission of an anti-particle of electron (positron) is
also called beta radiation. For this reason, a proton has to be converted into
the neutron inside the nucleus:

pt -> n® + é" + v (neutrino)
(This reaction cannot take place outside the nucleus. This is because the mass of
a neutron is more than that of a proton.)
In this process, the number of protons decreases by one and hence the atomic
number also decreases by one, and a nucleus of different element is formed.
Though neutrinos or anti-neutrinos are emitted during beta radiation, they are
not considered to be radioactive rays. This is because they are charge less and
they are so inert (or nonreactive) that even a few light years thick lead sheet
cannot stop a neutrino particle.
13.1.3 Gamma ray
A gamma ray is actually an energetic electromagnetic wave. It has no charge, but
as it is strong, its wavelength is very low (frequency is very high). Regardless of ~~,
the energy of the gamma ray, its velocity is equal to that of light. When a nucleus 5


--- Page 358 ---
Radioactivity and Electronics 353
0 it cannot be influenced by an

electric or magnetic field. Because it is charge less, it cannot directly ionize

atoms or molecules, but the electrons can ionize atoms or molecules in different

processes and from that we can understand the presence of gamma ray. To stop

gamma rays with energy equal to that of alpha and beta particles, a thick layer of

lead of several centimeters is needed.

13.1.4 Half Life

It is not possible to say the exact moment when a definite radioactive nucleus

will emit radioactive rays. Physics can only predict the probability of its

radiation. So the concept of Half Life is used to determine the amount of

radioactivity. The time in which half of the nucleus disintegrates (or radiates) is

known as half life. Therefore, the more the radioactivity of an element, the less

its half life is. The half life of a stable nucleus having no radioactivity can be

considered to be “infinity”.

It is necessary to know that radioactivity is a nuclear phenomenon, so a nucleus

is transformed into another through radioactive emission. A different nucleus

can accept or donate one or two electrons from the surroundings to become a

charge less atom. This is because the energy of the electrons of an atom is much

smaller than the nuclear energy of a nucleus.

Example

Question: The half life of a radioactive element of 1 kg is 100 years. What will be

its mass after 200 years?

Answer: Mass does not change directly due to radioactivity. Only three fourth

of the nuclei of the radioactive element will emit radioactive particles in 200

years.

13.1.5 Uses of Radioactivity

There are many different uses of Radioactivity. If a small amount of
radioactive sample is inserted into the body, information about the body
can be detected by observing the movement of the radioactive sample from
outside the body. Generally those radioactivity samples have a very low
half life, it may a few minutes, thus the radioactivity of the samples will be
finished within an hour.

Another important use of radioactivity is the determination of the age of
ancient fossils. In our body there is huge amount of carbon in which a
definite amount of C , is present. When an animal dies, no more C , can
enter the body further. The amount of carbon deposited before gets less due
to the half life. Thus knowing the amount of C , that would have normally
been present initially, and by calculating the amount which is decayed, age
can be determined accurately.

A radioactive element can cause harm to the cells of the body, so different
types of caution are taken. Radioactivity is used to destroy harmful cells
within the body. This is why, for the treatment of cancer radioactive
elements are used to destroy cancer cells.

Radioactivity is also used to make the equipment germ free, detecting the
presence of smoke and determining the amount of different metals in
minerals.

13.1.6 Cautions about Radioactivity

A high radioactive dose can cause many

problems in our body. When research started

about radioactivity, the scientists did not

know the bad effects of radioactivity. As a

result, scientists were attacked with many

diseases as they came close contact with

radioactivity. Due to working for a long time

with radioactive elements Marie Curie suffered

from leukemia and died. Radioactivity

decreases immunity against disease,

preventing capability of human and even

physical disable children are born inherently. Figure 13.02: Radioactive materials
We do not usually face radioactivity often are used very carefully because they .
in our daily life. Due to new are very dangerous. g

technology in the world, many people have started to face the bad effects of
radioactivity. The nuclear reactions in a nuclear power plant produce serious
radioactivity. Many radioactive wastes have high half life and can remain
radioactive for lakhs of years. There are even incidents of radioactive wastes
being spread into the surroundings due to accidents in nuclear power plants.
Many people faced radioactivity in the accident of a submarine run by nuclear
energy. The most devastating event took place in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki due to nuclear bombs. Many people were exposed to radioactivity.
So, many researchers have been started becoming concerned about radioactivity
and the determination of the safe limit of radioactivity is also started. General
people are now being warned about the effects of radioactivity (figure 13.02).
13.2 Development of Electronics
Electronics has a greatest contribution in the development of the modern
civilization and it is not an exaggeration by any means. The gradual
development of electronics can be divided into three parts, the vacuum tube,
transistor and integrated circuit.
13.2.1 Vacuum Tube
In 1883 Edison observed that in a light bulb, a current can flow through a
vacuum space from the filament to a metal plate. This process is known as the
Edison Effect. In 1904, John Flemming (on the basis of the Edison effect) first
created a vacuum tube with two electrodes, which worked as a rectifier i.e., it
converted an alternating current into a direct current. This vacuum tube is
considered as the introduction to electronics. At that time the exchange of
information was started by radio waves. Guglielmo Marconi needed such type of
vacuum tube to control of the radio waves. (It is noted that Marconi was
mentioned as the inventor of radio, but in recent times the contribution of
Bengali scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose is also acknowledged.)
In 1906 Lee De Forest invented another vacuum tube by adding a third
electrode, which is known by the name triode. This triode can control the flow
of electricity and used as an amplifier.

8 The development of vacuum tubes take place first through telegraph

communication using Morse code and then through the use of vocal
communication by telephone (Figure 13.03). During the first and second world
war, different types of specialized vacuum tubes were used in controlling weap-
ons, radar, navigation etc. In 1946 the first computer ENIAC was invented using
1800 vacuum tubes.
13.2.2 Transistor
In 1947 the Transistor was first invented in Bell Laboratory and for this
invention John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley were awarded
the Nobel Prize. No one could imagine at that time how fast and widely the
transistor would change the whole world.
A transistor can work just like a vacuum tube, but compared with a vacuum tube
it is very small in size, light in weight, and a very small amount of electricity is
needed to operate it, it is very reliable and most of all, it can be made at a very
low cost. Thus it rapidly secured its place, replacing the vacuum tube and the
people of the world began to get many electrical appliances by using this
transistor at very cheap.
13.2.3 Integrated Circuit
Although the discussion about an integrated circuit was started in 1952, a real
integrated circuit was started to be made in the sixth decade. In the fifth decade
many transistors were made on a thin silicon plate (Wafer) and eventually the
transistors were separated by cutting them from the plate. This process was a
improved to a small extent while preparing an integrated circuit. Not only S


--- Page 362 ---
Radioactivity and Electronics 357
a transistor but also creating a diode, resistor and a capacitor on a wafer, a
complete circuit was started to be made. This circuit was named an integrated
circuit (IC). With the development of technology many transistors were
assembled in a small area, and first it was named Large Scale Integration (LSI),
and then it is called Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI). These circuits were
made into a ready-made package so that they could be directly used in a circuit
board. Modern equipment such as the Micro-computer, clinical appliances,
video camera, communication satellite would never be possible without the use
of integrated circuits.
13.2.4 Electronics of Future
The technology of electronics is still advancing, and in the future we will
experience electronic circuits using optics or light in an information
communicative integrated circuit. At the same time we will observe the use of
programmable IC (FPGA: Field Programmable Gate Array) in different fields in
accordance to our own needs.
13.3 Analog and Digital Electronics
Things that are happening around us every moment, like sound, light, pressure,
temperature are expressed as information or data. Their values can be changed
continuously. We might need these values in our different works, so we preserve
and analyze these values and send them from one place to another. To process
the data we might use electronics. This continuously changing data can be
converted into electrical signals and these types of signals are called analog
signals. If we process these signals with a type of electronics, it is called analog
electronics. When discrete signals are processed, then it is called digital signal.
Continuously changing information or data signals can be processed in a
different way. To do this, we have to find the value for a definite interval of time
and express this in a type of number. Then we have to preserve this value
successively. Then we will be able to process these numbers using electronics.
When it is needed to convert this into the main analog signal again, then electric
signals of equal to serially preserved values have to be created. We use decimal
BS

358 Physics
numbers in our daily life. But in electronics numbers are expressed by binary
numbers, because they can be easily processed (voltage as 1 and zero voltage as
0). The number system expressed with the digits ‘0’ and ‘1° is a binary number
system. (Figure. 13.04)
The greatest contribution of electronics is the computer. The exchange of all data
or processing of all data in a computer is processed by digital electronics. Digital
electronics is also used in the internet and computer networks to exchange data.
Sound, image or video etc. start as analog signals (and is used as analog signal
too) but they are stored, processed and sent as digital signal. Noise can spoil the
quantity of analog signals very easily by entering the signals. Once it is
converted into digital signals, noise cannot enter it very easily. So, the quality of
digital signals remains unchanged.

A special type of IC is made to process digital signals. These IC’s have become
efficient gradually. That is, they can process a large number of signals at a very
short time accurately. Therefore, as time goes by, the process of digitizing is
becoming easier and it is needless to say that everything around us is being
converted into digital world. §

13.4 Semiconductor
The modern world and modern civilization have been built on the basis of
electronics. If we want to express our gratitude to any substance, that
substance will be the semiconductor. We have discussed about the conductor,
insulator and semiconductor. Now we can go deeper to a small extent about this
subject.

Figure 13.05 : Silicon crystal. Three dimentional silicon crystal (right)
In Figure 13.05 many atoms of a semiconductor have been shown side by side.
Due to the structure of the atom if there are eight electrons in their outer most
shells, in one sense they are fulfilled and become very stable. Atoms always try
to have eight electrons in their outer most shells. Silicon is the most used
semiconductor among the semiconductors. The number of electrons is four in its
outer most shell. But when we observe a silicon crystal, we find surprisingly that
there are eight electrons in the outer most shell of every atom! It has happened
because every atom attaches to four different atoms around it, and they are all
using their electrons sharing with the neighboring atoms. (We have drawn the
figure on a plane. The real arrangement of silicon atoms is three dimensional, as
shown at the right side of the Figure 13.05. Actually, every atom touches other
d four atoms.)

360 Physics
Usually the electrons are bound to the atoms in semiconductors. With the
increase of temperature, one or two electrons may become free. There are free
electrons in conductors so the semiconductors may act as conductors to some
extent. From to the view point of physics it is an interesting phenomenon, but
not very suitable for practical use. An interesting thing is done to make it more
useful. Atoms with five electrons in its outer most shell. e.g, phosphorous are
mixed with silicon crystal. Hence, the fifth electron of phosphorous becomes an
extra electron. It is not necessary for the extra electron to be bound to the
atoms of phosphorus. This electron behaves like free electrons by making the
phosphorus atom a positive ion. It can be said that such phosphorus adding
semiconductors act as conductors to a large extent, because there are some free
electrons here to carry charges. The semiconductors made by mixing atoms
having five electrons in the outer most shell like phosphorus are called n type
semiconductors.
Now get ready to hear something more interesting. Instead of adding pentavalent
impurity atoms, if we add atoms having three electrons (e.g. boron) in their outer
most shells, to silicon, what will happen? Certainly, it is understood that there is
an empty space in the orbit of a boron atom and this empty place can be occupied
by a neighboring electron. Then an empty place will be created in the
neighboring atom, this place again can be occupied by an electron of its
neighboring atom, then an empty place also will be created there. Another way
to see it is that an empty place with the lack of an electron is moving from atom
to atom. It seems that it is one type of particle and its charge is positive. It is
called a hole. That is, we can say that keeping a boron atom as a negative ion,
this hole can move through the whole silicon crystal. That is, this semiconductor
almost acts as a conductor and positively charged holes conduct electricity
through it! When a semiconductor becomes a conductor by adding atoms having
three electrons in their outer most shells, it is called a p-type semiconductor.
There were not so many uses of n type and p type semiconductors individually
but when n type and p type semiconductors were combined together the greatest
discovery of science and technology started.

caused by the use of computers. We have to be cautious so that these health
problems are not created. If we abide by some easy rules, we can prevent these
problems. e.g.

(a) We have to sit properly and look straight while working on computers.

(b) We have to take rest at least for 5 minutes after every half an hour and

relax the neck and shoulders.
(c) The screen of the computer should be 50 - 60 cm away from eyes.
(d) We have to look at something far away for a while, (after every 10 minutes)
so that eyes feel comfortable.
13.7.2 Mental Problem
Mental problems caused by excessive use of computers can be more severe than
physical problems. Now-a-days, everyone can use the internet due to its
availability. The realm of information and knowledge is opened in internet; on
the other hand, it can also cause problems for users through social network
services. Psychologists have started to show through research that people may
become addicted to excess use of computers, the internet, or social networks
( similar to the addiction to narcotics). There are even examples of death due to
excessive playing of computer games. Therefore, we always have to remember
that modern technology is not always good. As there are many unnecessary and
harmful technologies in the world, likewise, the misuse of good technologies
can also become a curse in our lives.
